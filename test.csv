57058,US,"Shows off the reasons why Dry Creek has achieved a good reputation for this finicky variety, Merlot. The wine isn't made big, gooey Napa-style. Instead, there's an herbal earthiness to the cherry-berry fruit, and the dry tannins suggest pairing with rich fare.",87,20.0,California

57066,Chile,"Bell pepper, green bean and asparagus aromas come with a touch of melon but nothing more fruity than that. A citrusy, round palate houses bitter, stretched flavors of green fruits and sulfur. Green herbs and citrus peel are the finishing notes on this grassy, green SB.",83,17.0,Leyda Valley
57067,Germany,"The Blue Fish series of cheery, fruit-forward Rieslings provides consistent quality at an easy price point. Ripe white peach and grapefruit flavors are plush and sweet but balanced squarely by a squirt of lemon-lime acidity. Enjoy now for it's fruity exuberance.",88,10.0,Pfalz

57072,France,"A wine that shows the superlative quality of white Burgundy in 2006, this is big, powerful and yet finely restrained. The yellow fruits are tempered with citrus, the weight and full character of the wine balanced with ultra-fresh acidity. Age this wine for 2–3 years.",93,,Burgundy
57073,Chile,"Pungent up front, with green herb, white pepper and citrus aromas, this is zesty and acidic on the palate, with a monotonous lemon flavor on the finish. It turns more tart and acidic as it airs.",84,12.0,Casablanca Valley

57078,US,"While bottled for four years now, this Cabernet is still developing bottle-aged notes. It's rich and jammy with blackberries, blueberries, cherries and mocha, along with a good overlay of oak. It's a pleasant wine to drink over the next few years.",87,56.0,California
57079,US,"This is a generous mouthful of Cabernet, with just small amounts of Merlot and Carmenère in the blend. Chewy, dusty, grainy, tannic and thoroughly delicious, it has the deeply flavored berry and cassis fruit to more than match the French oak. The fruit is wreathed in layers of smoke, charcoal and ash—all in proportion.",95,50.0,Washington
57080,France,"A black-fruited wine with a strong sense of structure and wood, it has spice and black-plum flavors that are held together by tannins. This can age for a few years.",87,12.0,Southwest France
57081,US,"A savory nose of seared beef crust gets lift from violet and lavender florals, and then the wine coats the palate very softly, with luscious flavors of stewed cherry, ripe cranberry and more herb-crusted roast. A licorice-aided acidity cleans the mouth on the finish.",93,61.0,California
57082,Italy,"One of Italy's most acclaimed Merlots, this concentrated wine opens with scents of black currants, cedar, sage and espresso. The firmly structured but polished palate delivers dried black cherry, black pepper, coffee and licorice alongside a backbone of velvety tannins. Drink 2017–2022.",94,400.0,Tuscany
57083,New Zealand,"Most of Saint Clair's Pioneer Block offerings are excellent, but the 2011 Block 16 from the Awatere comes across as a simple, fruit-driven Pinot Noir. A punched-up cherry note dominates, leaving little room for complexity or structure. Drink now.",84,30.0,Marlborough
57084,France,"The small region of Buzet halfway between Bordeaux and Toulouse produces fruity, ripe and full-bodied Bordeaux-blend wines. This rich example has soft tannins and a smooth texture. Blackberry fruit flavors are right up front with a light amount of juicy acidity at the end. It is ready to drink.",87,15.0,Southwest France
57085,US,Round Pond's track record with Sauvignon Blanc is pretty consistent. The wine is rarely great—almost never bad–but frequently satisfactory. The 2012 is one of their better efforts—a little ripe in profile—but clean and savory.,86,24.0,California
57086,US,"Still tasting quite young, this potent Pinot brings a dark streak of smoke and a splash of citrus to its core black-fruit flavors. The tannins are stiff and carry a hint of stem. Give this some further bottle age, and drink it between 2018 and 2028.",92,70.0,Oregon
57087,France,This blend of and Syrah is more ripe fruit than freshness. It is rounded and soft with caramel and spice flavors as well as rich strawberries. Drink now.,84,18.0,Southwest France

57091,US,"This is one big wine; and in our opinion it's largely overdone. When butter and burnt toast dominate fruit, it's not going to be perceived as being varietally correct, and most tasters will probably struggle to peg it as SB. From a flavor perspective, it's chock full of banana, baked apples and wood. The finish is resinous and thick. Call it a ripe case of more being less.",85,29.0,California
57092,US,"Soft, supple plum envelopes an oaky structure in this Cabernet, supported by 15% Merlot. Coffee and chocolate complete the picture, finishing strong at the end, resulting in a value-priced wine of attractive flavor and immediate accessibility.",87,19.0,California

57096,France,"Drawing a blend of Merlot, Tannat and Syrah from several regions in southwest France, this soft and fruity wine is light with a juicy mix of acidity and dry tannins. Berry fruits and a fresh aftertaste suggest it is ready to drink now.",87,12.0,France Other
57097,US,"Brawny but polished, this dark-colored and full-bodied Bordeaux-style blend has a tantalizing aroma of cedar and cigar box, then rich but bright fruit flavors and a satisfying layered and tannic texture. Great acidity and just-ripe fruit help it balance out the handsome oaky character and firm tannins. Best after 2019.",92,55.0,California
57098,Chile,"Saturated and creamy, but a little flat, dense and short on fruit. Even with its age, the palate is fairly closed and quiet, with hard tannins and modest bounce. Flavors of berry and black plum carry an herbal side note, and the finish is more tannic than smooth. Tempranillo with Cabernet Sauvignon, Monastrell and Carignan.",88,55.0,Curicó Valley
57099,US,"The Nuages cuvée delicately includes lightly peppery herbal notes in the fruit-filled wine that leans toward blueberries and cherries.

57100,US,"Mineral, dried peach, lees and honeysuckle aromas lead to just off-dry flavors. Racy acidity frames it nicely.",88,18.0,Washington

57102,Spain,"Soapy, floral aromas are wan, with no distinct fruit notes. This feels heavy as it stumbles around aimlessly. Plum and peach flavors are adequate, while the finish is mildly bitter, with sugary cherry notes.",84,13.0,Levante
57103,France,"A crisp, very fresh wine with flavors of red currants and open acidity and a light feel. A caramel taste rounds the wine through the finish.",83,9.0,Southwest France
57104,France,"A wine that tries too hard. The extract is strong, giving some bitterness. And, although the berry fruits are sweet and rich, the tannins edge the fruit with hardness. On the finish, some smokiness enhances the black currant juice, but that astringency just won't go away.",84,25.0,Bordeaux
57105,France,"This wine appears to need a bit more time to come fully into its own. Tight and dark with notes of blackberries, plum skin, burnt coffee residue and herbs, the full mouth is overcome by firm tannins on the finish, preventing much else from coming through on the end. Some aging (try at least a year) should bring things into balance.",87,17.0,Languedoc-Roussillon
57106,US,"This is a fairly light, bright Pinot Noir with the marks of a ripe year and time spent in oak. It is crafted under the guidelines of a certified sustainable grape growing program. Medium-bodied and juicy, it's fairly priced and ready to enjoy now.",86,29.0,California
57107,US,"This zesty icewine, with its lemon, spice and mineral backbone, offers a light and playful take on the dessert wine coveted by so many worldwide. Delicate and not overly sweet, this shows some restraint and subtlety, lending it to food pairing and solo sipping.",89,23.0,New York
57108,US,"A deep pink color and substantial flavors make this wine a little bigger and more wine-like than many other rosés. The red cherry and raspberry flavors and medium body will pair well grilled salmon, paella, and even slow-cooked ribs.",87,16.0,California
57109,Australia,"This kitchen-sink blend boasts a high percentage of Petit Verdot (38%), which may account for its dramatic floral aromatics. Aside from roses, cherries also play a role. In the mouth, complex floral-herbal elements have a solid underpinning of cherries and raspberries, finishing with just enough tannins to stand up to rare beef. —J.C.",87,24.0,South Australia
57110,South Africa,"A ripe and sultry selection, this offers upfront oak-derived notes of vanilla, toasted nut, sweet cedar and chocolate sauce. Fruity tones of brandied cherry, mashed raspberry and blackberry preserve provide a solid backbone for the woody, spicy character. The lush, full palate offers waves of tobacco and leather that carry through to the medium-length finish.",90,72.0,Western Cape
57111,France,This is a light and crisp Petit Chablis that is soft and totally ready to drink. Apricot and citrus flavors combine in a wine that is lightly mineral and very fruity. Drink now.,88,20.0,Burgundy

57113,Argentina,"Initially, this blend of Malbec, Cabernet Sauvignon and Tannat smells murky, leathery and nutty, but with airing it settles and cleans up. Chunky and close to being oversaturated, this full-bodied red tastes of loamy berry and raisin, while the finish is weighty.",89,35.0,Mendoza Province
57114,Germany,"Robust in body yet squarely structured, the Franz Anton shows more ripeness and concentration than the producer's standard-label bottling. Fleshy black cherry and berry flavors are ripe, but are offset by crisp acidity and a shroud of smoke and toast that accents without overwhelming. It's bold and penetrating, with a long finish marked by fine, persistent tannins. Delicious already, but bold enough to improve through at least 2030.",94,42.0,Baden
57115,US,"With a reductive quality and prominent oak, this is a thick, concentrated wine built on unwavering tannins. The fruit is elusive and shy. Clove and cola eke out of an earthy element that's part rose garden, part smoke and eucalyptus.",86,59.0,California
57116,US,"This overtly woody wine smells like cedar chips and fresh-cut oak and tastes like pine, menthol and cherry candy. While it's fun to pick out its different flavors, this is not what most people expect from Cabernet.",84,15.0,California
57117,US,"This is fruity and clean, with plenty of pretty cherry-fruit flavor. A whiff of wood smoke and pipe tobacco carves its way through the fruit and into the finish.",87,9.0,Washington
57118,US,"This is an earthy, chalky wine, medium bodied and silky in wild strawberry, garden herb and fresh mint notes. From estate-grown Pinot, it is a balanced, accessible selection to drink now.",90,50.0,California
57119,US,"Essentially a Cabernet Franc with Merlot and Sangiovese in the blend, this easy-drinking red wine feels a bit generic. One-dimensional berry and pale cherry fruit flavors quickly fade into light tannins.",83,18.0,Washington
57120,US,"Meant to provide value, this wine also offers big oak, smoke and a bittersweet taste of black-tea tannins. Shy in fruit, this has a slightly reduced effect on the finish.",84,20.0,California

57122,US,Delicate sweetness and lip-smacking juiciness come together in this off-dry Riesling. It's zesty and light-footed but chock full of peach and grapefruit nectar glazed with caramelized sugar. Drink now through 2018 to maximize its youthful energy.,88,13.0,New York
57123,US,"Law enforcement veteran-turned-winemaker Cindy Cosco named this brand for her Italian roots, and presents violet, red cherry and pencil-lead aromas in this bottling. A wild-herb character powers the palate, with bay leaf most prominent, followed by tart elderberries and orange-peel sourness. The grippy palate will open more with age.",87,47.0,California
57124,US,"This Marin County Pinot may have suffered from the cool vintage as the raspberry and cherry flavors that it opens with veer into bitter territory. The texture is fine, heavier than usual, the wine just having a hard time coming around.",84,36.0,California
57125,Australia,"Grapefruit and mint make for an interesting and attractive couple on the nose, while tart citrus and a bit of grass make up the flavor profile. It hails from Western Australia, and overall it gets the job done. On the down side, however, is a slight vinegar note.",87,17.0,Western Australia
57126,US,"This wine is subtle in aroma but extremely generous in texture. It seems to start out slow and then floods the palate with very ripe but not sweet flavors like kiwi, pear and honeydew melon on a nicely viscous, pillowy texture.",91,20.0,California
57127,US,"K-J's basic Cab has gotten pricier over the years, but quality has kept up. This wine still offers excellent value. It's elegant in construction, with tailored tannins and acids and fine flavors of blackberries and currants that lead to a spicy finish.",88,24.0,California
57128,France,"An intriguing wine, that offers ripe sweetness followed by an edgy rustic acidity. Is this a stage in its evolution? Probably, because the tannins promise aging and the intensely aromatic nature of the fruit points to a potentially fine wine. Just don't drink it yet.",89,55.0,Burgundy
57129,France,"Warm and aromatic hints of ripe Bosc pear pervade the aromatics of this wine. The palate has a rounded, ripe feel but remains beautifully slender, expressing more of that pear fruit now highlighted by citrus freshness. It's a very balanced, dry wine with a clean finish.",91,47.0,Alsace
57130,,"This Bulgarian Chardonnay is fermented in egg-shaped concrete vessels and has aromas of anise fronds and citrus blossom. There are lively flavors of lemon zest, grapefruit pith and lemon curd in the mouth. It has nice balance and a pleasant touch of ripe yellow peach in the finish.",89,20.0,
57131,US,"Cherry spice and earthy compost meet in this well-made, full-bodied wine from a warm vintage. Despite its density and concentration, it's freshened by bright acidity and a streak of cinnamon cola that lasts into the finish.",91,65.0,California
57132,US,"Aromatic for the variety, this wine shows notes of apple and pear. It's lightly spritzy with an almost unctuous feel.",86,15.0,Washington
57133,US,"The Summum block sits at the vineyard's highest elevation, and seems to ripen more slowly and give extra complexity at lower sugar levels. Elegant and refined, with fruit flavors less in your face than its sister cuvées, this mixes citrus flavors of lemon, lime and pink grapefruit, along with lighter suggestions of pineapple and a hint of papaya. It's complex and captivating, with a long, racy finish.",94,90.0,Oregon
57134,France,"Toast and blackberry aromas set the scene for this ripe, bold, fruity wine. With tannins, spice from wood-aging and a still-firm texture, it's showing its youth, but the rich blackberry fruit and density promise long life ahead. Drink from 2020.",90,27.0,Bordeaux
57135,US,"Young, dense, tannic and oaky, a tough wine that resists the palate. There's a core of blackberry and currant fruit, and things may resolve themselves over the years. Yet it doesn't seem to have the integrity of Stonestreet's other '07s.",88,75.0,California
57136,US,"Bright lemon, nectarine and pineapple tones are touched with green herbs and savory pollen notes in this ephemerally sheer, light-bodied Riesling. Off dry on the palate, it boasts a mouth quenching grapefruit juiciness.",87,15.0,New York
57137,Israel,"This wine offers aromas of raspberry and toffee. There is a nice interplay of fruit, floral, and minty flavors, notably raspberry, cherry, toffee, rose petal and eucalyptus.

57138,France,"There is some good structure here, as befits a Saint-Estèphe, along with intense fruits and ripe blackberry flavors. That makes the wine both very drinkable now and gives it aging for the next two years. The aftertaste with its juicy acidity is already attractive.",88,20.0,Bordeaux
57139,US,"Pure Cabernet, aged in the same Vicard barrels as winemaker Randy Dunn's Howell Mountain wines. About 90% is new oak, but it doesn't strangle the fruit in any way. Tart and vibrant, with black cherry/black currant fruit, this balanced effort shows a velvety character and a fine touch in the vineyard. Nuances of coffee, earth, leaf and dried herb are threaded through, in perfect harmony and balanced for medium-term aging.",93,60.0,Washington
57140,France,"Chardonnay from the Loire spotlights the grape at its freshest. This lightly vanilla flavored wine is dominated by apple and pear flavors. The smooth texture is pierced with tight, mineral acidity that makes the wine so fruity and crisp. Drink now and until 2017.",84,,Loire Valley
57141,US,"Pretty aromas of pure Pinot fruit, a mix of cola, earth, cherry and root beer introduce this estate bottling. Still a bit tight, perhaps even bottle shocked, it nonetheless opens up with breathing time into a balanced, elegant and stylish effort.",89,60.0,Oregon

57147,US,"Vespera combines Cabernet Sauvignon, Petit Verdot, Merlot and Petite Sirah from two of the winery's signature vineyards, Grigsby and Collinetta, into an explosion of chocolate, mint and intense tannins. A tropical layer lurks on the back palate, making the wine an intriguing quaff.",91,50.0,California
57148,US,"Dark and rich, with plummy, tomato flavors and quite a bit of tannin. It's very dry, with a real bite of acidity. Doesn't have the stuffing for aging, but it is a big, clean bruiser of a wine, and will drink nicely with rich foods.",85,16.0,California
57149,US,"This wine's cranberry, raspberry and cherry flavors are spicy and tart, carrying a suggestion of hard candy. It's consistent throught its tart finish and promises much development ahead. Drink now through the late 2020s.",91,60.0,Oregon
57150,US,"A barrel selection from the 30-acre estate vineyard, this has a bit more muscle than its companion Amalie's Cuvée, with a more firm and full mid-palate.

Good balance and restraint, with the structure to age gracefully for up to a decade.",89,50.0,Oregon
57151,England,"Faint hints of red currant join the creamy notes on the nose. The palate falls in with more fresh berry fruit and paints a picture of utter charm.

57152,US,"Annette Hoff Danzer is only the second female winemaker in Monterey County, and her wine from Chualar Canyon on the east side of the Salinas Valley offers aromas of fragrant white flowers, lemon-lime soda and lychee.

57154,France,"With aromas dominated by minty new wood, this is a modern style of wine, the wood on the palate very dominant. There is enough black currant fruit to promise a rounding out of what at the moment is a dry, densely structured wine. Keep for 4–5 years.",89,,Bordeaux
57155,US,"Lemon curd, white peach and tangerine aromas make for a nicely rounded nose in this appellation blend. It's a very familiar Chardonnay expression on the palate, with a citrus edge that cuts through ripe pear and sea salt flavors. The mouthfeel shows chalky tension.",88,28.0,California

57163,US,"Fine berry fruit, dried flowers, and an olive note mark the intriguing nose of this very dry, even austerely elegant blend. Very mature, almost raisiny fruit and dark-chocolate flavors cover the palate. A full finish with tobacco notes wraps up this very masculine package. Hold until 2005.",89,80.0,California
57164,Chile,"Light and generally clean smelling, with standard green apple, melon and lime aromas. Feels a touch flat and pithy for Casablanca, with generic citrus and mild bitterness for flavors. Pithy and just juicy enough on the finish.",86,12.0,Casablanca Valley

57168,Chile,Cherry and cassis aromas are both a touch raisiny and candied. This has a high-acid mouthfeel to go with generic red-fruit flavors that turn a bit weedy the longer this is exposed to air. A quick finish is low on depth.,84,23.0,Central Valley
57169,US,"Shows the briary, scoury mouthfeel that so often characterizes Dry Creek Valley red wines, as opposed to the smooth lushness of neighboring Napa Valley. The flavors are just fine, of wild blackberries, cherries and cola. Drink over the next six years.",87,45.0,California
57170,France,"The white wines of Pernand-Vergelesses have managed to preserve a cool, crisp character even in warm 2015. This wine has the citrus well to the fore along with flavors of wood aging and spice. It is tangy and mineral, with a bright textured aftertaste. Drink from 2020.",92,90.0,Burgundy
57171,Germany,"Dramatically ripe, this delicately framed spätlese is a showcase of pristine, sunny peach and Meyer lemon flavors accented by caramel and crystallized honey. It's nuanced as well, darting with acidity and touches of sea salt and slate that persist.",93,33.0,Mosel
57172,Chile,"Pickled, briny aromas of canned vegetables are common for this wine and Casa Marin. On the palate, high acidity sticks out and lends an iron grip to this original coastal SB. A mix of citrus and vegetal flavors include notes of pumpkin and pickled beans.",87,27.0,San Antonio
57173,France,"Perfumed and deliciously aromatic, this is full of bright fruitiness, with a lemon zest tang and lively acidity. Great as an apéritif, it's ready to drink now.",87,20.0,Alsace
57174,US,"The Cabernet is stiffened up with small amounts of Petit Verdot, Cab Franc and Malbec, resulting in a firm, herbal, but very well-balanced Bordeaux-style blend. There's compact cassis fruit, streaked with light stem, earth and herb. This is a wine that should improve with bottle age through 2019.",91,30.0,Washington
57175,US,"This isn't a very complex Merlot, but it is textbook if you're looking for soft fruitiness. It has oak-influenced cherry and blackberry flavors, with hints of violets and fruit tea, and is dry and dusty in tannins. Give it more concentration and it would be a star.",87,19.0,California
57176,US,"This 100% varietal Cabernet Sauvignon shows cocoa, green herb and cherry notes, with a hint of volatility. It's medium bodied on the palate, with scratchy tannins.",86,36.0,Washington
57177,Italy,"A wine that gives you everything you could possibly want: complexity, elegance, intensity and a long, creamy finish. Oreno is a 50-25-25 blend of Merlot, Cabernet Sauvignon and Sangiovese (which prove to be perfect proportions in this case). It exhibits aromas of bright cherry, prune, plum, espresso grinds and cedar wood.",94,85.0,Tuscany
57178,South Africa,"There's a pretty touch of carnation florals to the dried black fruit and black cherry center of this wine. Spicy notes of black pepper, whole clove and black tea leaves appear in the mouth alongside juicy blackberry and fudgy brownie flavors.",88,16.0,Stellenbosch
57179,US,"This is so smooth, rich and mellow, you hardly notice how intense the tannins are. But they are hard, and lock down the flavors of black currant and black licorice, plus the complex notes of minerals, roasted game and dark spices. Drink this Malbec-based blend now after decanting and over the next six years.",93,75.0,California
57180,US,"Few wines out of Napa Valley need age as much as this one does. That's due to its mountain origins and the cool vintage, which combine to make the tannins pushy and hard. But once they start to fall out, the blackberry and currant flavors should emerge, pure and sweet. Best after 2010, but if you open it before that, decant.",91,65.0,California
57181,US,"Soft and candied, with cherry jam, gingersnap cookie and vanilla flavors that are a little on the sweet side.",83,12.0,California
57182,US,"The majority of the grapes for this white that's musky on the nose was stainless-steel fermented, with 20% given time in neutral French oak. The combination provides easygoing texture, accented by notes of grass and herb. A fleck of stone fruit and papaya tease midpalate before an abbreviated finish.",85,30.0,California
57183,Portugal,"A ripe style of Sauvignon Blanc with no barrel aging, this shows apple and apricot flavors along with just a squeeze of lemon acidity. It is rich, softly textured and ready to drink now.",85,22.0,Alentejano
57184,US,"The reserve gets 90% new French oak, and there is a strong scent of oaky toast, with flavors that follow. Plump cherry fruit fills a broad midpalate, finishing with rather hard tannins that show a green edge.",87,39.0,Oregon
57185,US,"Just the second vintage for this Cab/Syrah blend, it sets its umami-soaked fruit in a crusty, toasty framework. Adding a splash (here 10%) of Syrah was once known in Bordeaux as to “Hermitager” the wine, bringing color and spice into the mix. This relatively soft Cabernet shows highlights of orange peel, apricot, pepper and cured meat.",93,90.0,Oregon
57186,US,"This excellent vineyard has a proven track record, though here the grapes seem unevenly ripened, with brambly berry fruit that turns a little hot and raisined in the finish. Hints of cola and Dr. Pepper add some welcome depth to the flavors.",87,30.0,Oregon
57187,France,"With firm tannins and ripe, balanced fruit, this is a success for the vintage, profiting from the dry conditions during harvest in Saint-Estèphe. Blackberry fruits and rich tannins give the wine shape and aging potential. Keep the wine until 2019.",91,,Bordeaux
57188,US,"This is a nice, plush Cabernet, soft and sweet in blackberry, currant and chocolate fruit flavors, but it's not a classic example of Mount Veeder Cabs, which are usually drier and more tannic. Drink in the short term.",87,86.0,California
57189,New Zealand,"Power and grace combine in this tour de force from Helen Masters, Ata Rangi's winemaker. Toasty oak frames intense black cherry fruit, with hints of herbs adding a savory element. Firm tannins provide ample structure, while the lengthy finish prolongs the pleasure. Drink 2018–2025.",94,55.0,Martinborough
57190,France,"The 2015s from the Tavel cooperative universally impressed. This cuvée, drawn from terroirs dominated by galets roulés, combines notes of crushed stones and ripe cherries. It's still tight and primary; like many good Tavels, it should drink better two years from the harvest than it does now.",92,,Rhône Valley
57191,US,"No longer an oddity, making a white wine out of Pinot Noir creates a most useful alternative to Chardonnay. Apples and white peaches abound, with a full, creamy mouthfeel. It's round and fresh with a pleasing sprinkle of cinnamon spice.",88,24.0,Oregon
57192,US,"This marks the debut of the Ramos Vineyard Chardonnay, inspired by a high-elevation site planted in 2001 by the late Bob Sessions and Jose Ramos, now director of vineyard operations. The wine paints a portrait of high-toned, elegant minerality accented by peach and lithe lemon. Capable of aging, it dances in acidity, with just a hint of caramel-vanilla on the finish. Made in tiny quantities, it's worth desperately seeking out.",95,78.0,California
57193,US,"This Pinot tastes so oaky, it's like chewing on barrel staves. Notes of vanilla, buttered toast and the creamy-sweet flavor of oak sap completely overwhelm what otherwise seems like a good wine. This is a real outlier among MacPhail's other 2010 Pinot Noirs.",85,59.0,California
57194,France,"A smooth and ripe wine, it's full of yellow fruits and pineapple, with just a touch of more herbaceous, citrus flavors. The wine is full-bodied, its acidity a gentle, juicy cut into the rich fruitiness. Drink from 2015.",88,,Loire Valley
57195,Italy,"Scrio boasts chunky aromas of clove, milk chocolate, coconut and pulsing blueberry. You can definitely identify the hot vintage in the wine's complex DNA although it isn't a big issue in terms of quality. The mouthfeel is polished and firm and the wine's long finish is amazing.",90,210.0,Tuscany
57196,France,"Spice-edged, rounded notes of ripe Mirabelle with playful, teasing topnotes of peach beckon from the glass. This aromatic, fruitful charm also fills the palate where a bright core of lemon freshness provides verve and structure that also suggests stones and rock. Purity and clarity lets those peachy notes dance all the more. It has an exquisite, joyful, light touch with a dry finish.",93,48.0,Alsace
57197,US,"This is a brand-new bottling from Merry Edwards. It's her first from Westside Road, which is warmer than her haunting grounds around the southern part of the valley. It's quite a promising debut. The wine is round, soft, charming and complex, with elaborate cherry, blackberry, licorice and cola flavors. It feels important and ageworthy. Drink now, with several hours of decanting, or cellar through 2020.",95,54.0,California
57198,France,"For a wine from this appellation, this is soft, bringing out ripe fruit rather than structure. It means the wine will develop quickly and with charm as well as richness. The red fruits are already showing well, as is crisp acidity. Drink from 2018.",88,65.0,Burgundy
57199,France,"This dense wine is now beginning to mature. It has the bold black fruit of the vintage, which is overlaid by dark chocolate notes and some bitterness. Still firm, it will probably need to age. Drink from 2019.",89,30.0,Bordeaux
57200,Germany,"Bold in alcohol, with a dry, intensely textured palate, this Riesling is rich and ripe, with notes of honeysuckle, peach and even a hint of berry. It carries its girth well, with a zippy streak of lemon acidity that cuts through all the ripeness, leading to a long, subtly mineral finish.",93,91.0,Rheingau
57201,US,"Former Wild Horse proprietor Ken Volk is back with his own personal brand after selling the winery. He's sourced his fruit from this very famous old vineyard. It's a good start, a deep golden wine showing ripe apricot, pear and sweet smoky oak flavors.",87,24.0,California
57202,Austria,"Clean-cut zesty freshness pervades nose and palate with lively, ripe and toothsome citrus zest: mandarin and lemon dominate. The palate is sleek and slender with focus and verve. Wonderfully bracing.",90,30.0,Kamptal
57203,Germany,"Notes of hay, pollen and beeswax add a savory, honeyed tone to this exquisitely dainty Riesling. The palate is intensely packed with sweet citrus fruit, but it's balanced with striking acidity and a shower of minerality on the finish.",91,83.0,Mosel
57204,US,"Ripe and floral in pencil lead, this estate-grown wine is subdued in fruit, preferring instead to conjure savory and herbal notes from the glass. Tobacco, leather and wild anise support that context and statement, the texture roundly lush.",91,79.0,California
57205,Spain,"Jammy, gritty berry aromas set up a rubbery, full-force palate that doesn't tread lightly. Roasted, almost burnt black-fruit flavors finish firm. Overall, this feels right, while the flavors run a touch baked, rustic and stalky.",88,10.0,Catalonia
57206,France,"Attractive spice and green-fruit aromas lead to this fresh, ripe wine. Touches of wood give a spicy buttery taste that contrasts easily with the flavors. Fruity with a light mineral character, it is ready to drink.",90,50.0,Burgundy
57207,US,"This is a red wine for white wine drinkers. It's silky and vibrantly crisp in acidity, like a Sauvignon Blanc, except the flavors are pure Pinot, suggesting sour cherry candy, persimmons and tart cranberries. Drink now–2017.",88,35.0,California
57208,US,"This Dijon clone fruit, barrel fermented and aged on the lees, delivers a wine of exceptional concentration and intensity. Deeply fruity, with a lush mix of apple, pear and peach, it also brings flashy barrel flavors and impressive length. The persistent, tightly wound finish bodes well for further aging. Drink now through 2028.",94,75.0,Oregon
57209,Israel,"This medium-weight selection offers concentrated aromas and flavors of black currant and blackberry laced with accents of pepper and earthy spice. There's a bit of bite to the moderate tannins, while hints of tobacco leaf and cocoa nib spice up the finish.",87,22.0,Samson

57212,Italy,"A blend of 50% Sangiovese, 25% Merlot and 25% Cabernet Sauvignon, this presents lovely fragrances of blue flower, incense and tilled soil.

57214,US,"Oakville specialist Far Niente turns to Rutherford for this single-vineyard, 100% Cab. The wine is soft and exceptionally ripe in blackberry and cherry fruit flavors, while lots of toasty oak adds vanilla accents that make the wine jammy. Doesn't have the structural complexity of the Oakville bottlings, but sure is tasty.",90,90.0,California
57215,US,"A whiff of volatility brightens up the aromas of this ripe Merlot. The structure is tight and compact, and the acidity is substantial. Clean fruit flavors of red and black berries can be found, but this is a year in which all of the Fielding Hills wines would benefit from a bit more bottle age to knit together.",89,36.0,Washington
57216,US,"This wine combines 38% Cabernet Sauvignon with 35% Merlot, 9% Petit Verdot and 1% Cabernet Franc, with fruit from Stagecoach and Alta vineyards contributing to the mix.

57217,US,"Made from a majority of Cabernet Sauvignon, this wine also contains a hearty amount of Syrah, along with smaller additions of Merlot, Malbec, Petit Verdot, Cabernet Franc and Sangiovese.

57218,Italy,"Made with 60% Cabernet Sauvignon and 40% Merlot, this delicately fragrant wine offers alluring scents of dark-skinned berry, purple flower and a whiff of cedar. The bright light-bodied palate offers red currant and star anise framed in racy acidity and lithe tannins.",89,56.0,Tuscany

57222,New Zealand,"The Sauvignon Blanc style here has gotten more refined and restrained in recent years, less opulent and flamboyant. This hints at snow pea and struck flint on the nose, then delivers primarily grapefruit on the palate, ending on a slightly austere note.",89,30.0,Marlborough
57223,France,"A big, ripe and juicy wine packed with black fruit notes and laced with acidity. The tannins offer a contrast to the fruitiness, bringing balance and structure. This is an impressive wine, the smoky aftertaste bringing out the wood aging.",91,25.0,Bordeaux
57224,US,"Dark fruit shows on the palate in this exotically spiced and floral blend from several vineyards, including Sangiacomo Roberts Road. Soft and medium in weight, it has high-toned acidity underneath the brooding spice and forest floor.",91,52.0,California
57225,US,"Restrained on the nose, this bottling by Richard Sanford and Nick de Luca shows light aromas of Marcona almond, lemon zest, Asian pear and Gravenstein apple. The sip is delicate in texture yet grippy with tannic structure, revealing pear flesh and squeezed lime flavors.",91,30.0,California
57226,US,"Medium ruby along the rim, with purple in the core, this Merlot starts off with ripe red cherry and plum on the nose, with fern and warm spice adding nuance. The palate is soft and plush, with grippy black-tea tannins supporting juicy red-fruit flavors.",87,22.0,Virginia
57227,US,"Soft supple tannins open a gateway of big bold respectable power and flavor in this vineyard designate from the famous Napa Valley grower. Black pepper, mountain-like sage, milk chocolate, cedar and pencil shavings all rise to the fore of this impressive, complex, interwoven wine that should do well in the cellar and be enjoyable now.",93,125.0,California
57228,France,"The wine has the firm tannins of the appellation, moderated by the black-currant fruitiness of the vintage. Spice and the dry structure will allow it to age well. With the same winemaking team as Château Lynch-Bages in Pauillac, it will age well. Drink from 2022",91,,Bordeaux
57229,France,"Some barrel aging has given this wine, with its already ripe fruits, extra richness. It is spicy, lifted by juicy acidity from the black cherries and plums. This is a full, warm and ripe wine that is just now ready to drink.",89,23.0,Loire Valley
57230,France,"89–91. Barrel sample. This wine is marked by new-wood spice and strong structure that showcases a sense of weight and spicy ripeness. The palate is powerful, while also maintaining a bold, juicy character.",90,,Bordeaux
57231,France,"Very much in an elegant style, this wine shows soft, almost velvet tannins supporting the ripe fruit. It has richness, a round character masking the dense texture, and setting off the clean red berry fruits and fresh acidity.",93,,Bordeaux

57234,US,"Big, rich and flashy, this is a wine of fruit-driven power. The notes of cherries, blackberries and currants are strong and jammy, and it's oaky, too. The finish is tannic and dry, so you may want to cellar it for a couple of years.",88,65.0,California
57235,US,"Fresh-pressed blackberries and graphite comprise the aromatic entry to this bottling from a vineyard about 2,000 feet high in the hills west of Paso Robles. It features plenty of wild thyme, black licorice and other garrigue-like herbals on the nose as well. The palate is minty, with a strong tannic tension and rising acidity.",90,58.0,California
57236,US,"While this wine's Mount Eden sister bottling may better stand the test of time, the Domaine Eden is what most people will most like to drink right now, and it's cheaper too. Aromas of dried violets, uncrushed boysenberries and pencil lead make for an ethereal nose that seems to hold secrets one must uncover. Precise tannins on the palate offer floral yet savory flavors of black sesame, nori, violet and mulberry. It's mellow yet mysterious.",95,35.0,California

57242,US,"Hearty rhubarb, cranberry and cherry notes meet with copious spices, from allspice to cinnamon to vanilla, on the nose of this bottling that also shows dust and cigar box. It's boisterous with fresh flavors on the palate, where black raspberry and juicy strawberry flavors are cut by sharp spice and a pine-needle finish.",91,45.0,California
57243,US,"Velvety chocolate and dark plum flavors give this wine a smooth, satisfying mouthfeel, assisted by well-integrated oak. Dark and brooding, it reflects its hillside provenance without succumbing entirely to an overripe or overdone style.",90,75.0,California
57244,US,"Michael Gill goes for broke booze-wise on this hot number, but the rewards are worth the risk. Aromas of blueberry, mint, graphite, dried cherry, lilac and graphite get a sagebrush lift. On the palate, distinct black licorice accompany blackberry syrup and white pepper.

57245,US,"This shows a fine balance of citrus and tropical fruit richness with a firm minerality, and the oak is pleasantly in the background. A touch of lees character gives it a Champagne-like doughiness.",92,28.0,California
57246,US,"This is the most attractive and successful of the winery's three releases of 2007 Pinot Noir. It's dry and crisp in acidity and very rich, with oak-inspired waves of cherries, cola, mushu plum sauce and smoky sandalwood. Drink this elegant wine in the next year or two.",90,35.0,California
57247,Chile,"Aromas of cherry and currant are a bit flat. On the palate, this is perfectly good but common. Blackberry, plum and a dusting of chocolate are the key flavors, while this runs long and loamy on the finish.",88,14.0,Colchagua Valley

57250,Chile,"Melon and candied aromas are sweet, and soon some toasty oak enters the fray. Flavors of candy corn, ripe apples and mango get a boost from the oak, and overall the feel is properly zesty and not too resiny or milky.

57251,US,"Succulent, dense and syrupy, this dessert Riesling brings a lush midpalate of honey, blossom, tea, candied citrus, butterscotch and more. It's loaded with flavor, just a little high-toned, and falls on the soft side for Washington dessert wines. But delicious? You bet!",88,30.0,Washington

57254,France,"Produced from a small vineyard in Pouilly Fuissé, this rich wine is full of ripe, generous fruit. Spice and yellow-fruit flavors blend seamlessly with the soft texture and perfumed acidity. It is developing into a very fine wine, ready to drink from 2017.",92,28.0,Burgundy
57255,US,"Nicole's is a consistent stunner, upholding its reputation just fine with this vintage, a vibrant and spicy take on rich, robust cherry and black raspberry that's both juicy and smooth. The finish wraps up nicely with a take on dark chocolate and mint.",93,65.0,California
57256,Australia,"One of Australia's most expensive and sought-after Cabernet blends, Mount Mary's Quintet has failed to impress more than one American critic.

57257,US,"Still young and tight, this roughly equal mix of Merlot and Cabernet Franc is showing beautiful complexity in the nose.

57259,US,"Shows the very dry herbal, floral and tobacco flavors that often mark Napa Chardonnays (and the vineyard is on the Napa side of Carneros). But there's a good core of tropical citrus fruits, while oak adds needed richness of smoky vanilla and buttered toast. Drink now.",87,50.0,California

57266,US,"Wood aromas of cedar are expertly spliced with purple fruits on this blend of Cabernet Sauvignon, Malbec, Petite Sirah and Merlot. A touch of greenness on the palate gives those deep purple fruits some depth, but the tannins are quite gripping, and should release more with time. Drink 2018 onward.",88,30.0,California

The flavors show depth and intensity as well as exquisite balance and length.",92,75.0,Oregon
57271,US,"Your classic Sonoma Coast flavors have a feral element, suggesting foresty mushrooms, pine cones and mineral things alongside the pomegranates and cranberries. That's just what you get in this bottling from Siduri. The chilly vintage has made it lighter and lower in alcohol than the rich 2007, but it's more elegance and complex. This is a very interesting wine, one to linger over as it breathes in the glass.",92,48.0,California
57272,New Zealand,"Leafy and nettle-like upfront, but deepening a bit on the palate to show nectarine, grapefruit and tomatillo notes.

Drink now.",87,11.0,Marlborough

57274,US,"The word scrumptious applies here. This rich and complex rosé from Eric Hamacher is a mix of saignée juice and Pinot Noir blanc that wasn't quite blanc enough—a happy accident, since it's packed with raspberry confit and plum jam flavors, with a hint of cranberry sauce. Coming up on two years past fermentation, it's a wine to drink now.",90,20.0,Oregon
57275,US,"With 4% Viognier giving this wine a distinct floral lift, it's aromatic with notes of nectarine, pear and toasty barrel spice. It's creamy, almost oily in feel, with an assortment of stone fruit flavors that carry through the finish.",88,12.0,Washington
57276,France,"Aromatic notes of orange peel and flesh charm on the nose of this wine. The palate is gentle, dry and fresh, with a super-clean finish offering apple and grapefruit.",89,15.0,Alsace
57277,US,"With aromas like sweet vanilla and candied cherries, and similarly syrupy flavors, this might make a better after-dinner wine than a table wine. The acidity and tannins are very subdued, so the overt fruitiness and oaky sweetness take over.",84,13.0,California
57278,Australia,"Winemaker Larry Cherubino has crafted an excellent yet affordable Pinot Noir. Hints of cedar and vanilla accent the cherry fruit, while the texture is appropriately supple without being overripe. The oak is prominent, but the weight and texture hit the mark. Drink now.",90,20.0,Victoria
57279,Italy,"There's a lot to love on this juicy, delicious wine, starting with aromas of ripe, dark-skinned berry, baking spice, leather, sun baked soil and menthol. The elegant, structured palate delivers ripe black cherry, cinnamon, anise and tobacco while firm, polished tannins provide support and finesse. A blast of orange zest signals the close.",94,69.0,Tuscany
57280,US,"This winery is approaching cult status, and for good reason. Rather than compete with over-extracted competitors, this bottling shows a medium richness that pairs black plum and dark chocolate with light mint and dried herbs. Oregano, thyme, sage, bay leaf and black pepper power the palate, where boysenberry fruit and pencil lead complete the fresh but layered experience.",93,99.0,California
57281,US,"The blend is Cabernet Sauvignon, Syrah, Merlot and Malbec. Cab Sauv brings rich black currants, as well as thick tannins. Merlot adds softer notes of cherries and violets. The Malbec increases the tannins, along with notes of grilled meat bone that Syrah, with its peppery, beef-jerky meatiness, enhances. The result is a young, vigorous wine, dry and balanced in acidity. It may or may not age, but there's no reason not to decant it now and enjoy with grilled beefsteak.",91,44.0,California
57282,US,"Three-quarters Cabernet Sauvignon with the rest Syrah, Merlot and Malbec, it brings notes of bell pepper, herbs, plum and black currant. The flavors are sugar sweet and plump with distinct residual sugar remaining.",83,17.0,Washington
57283,US,"Rich, ripe and flashy, this Cabernet scores high on the deliciousness factor. That is Peju's speciality, and here they have produced a gorgeous wine of soft tannins, creaminess and ripe black currant, anise and dark chocolate flavors. Tasty now, and will stay fresh for up to five years.",89,45.0,California
57284,Australia,"As might be expected from winemaker Roman Bratasiuk, this is a full-bodied, rich Syrah, loaded with dark scents of roast coffee, blueberries and baking spices. Blueberry, menthol and spice flavors dominate the palate, finishing long. Despite the massive richness, there's plenty of elegance, too. Imported by Wine Brokers Unlimited.",93,110.0,South Australia
57285,France,"This is a concentrated wine, full of blackberry fruits with acidity and spice. The wood-aging character is balancing out well, giving structure without dominating the fruit. Drink from 2020. Grapes are vinified by variety and plot from the 60-acre vineyard of Cabernet Sauvignon (55%), Merlot (40%) and Petit Verdot (5%). The property was purchased by Jean-Christophe Mau in 2004.",89,50.0,Bordeaux
57286,Argentina,"Earthy, mossy, cedary aromas of berry fruits come with spice and coffee notes. This is fairly high in tartaric acid, so it scrapes across the palate. Quick-passing flavors of wild berry fruits and plum are toasty and lightly herbal, while the finish on this Cabernet Sauvignon blend is tight, spicy and grating in feel. Drink through 2022.",91,55.0,Mendoza Province
57287,US,"Irresistably delicious and reminiscent of cru Burgundy, this laser-focused effort features bright Meyer lemon, tangerine and peach flavors, with plenty of juicy acidity. It grows deeper and richer as it breathes—and seems to disappear way too quickly once opened.",94,35.0,Oregon
57288,US,"Extremely luscious on the nose, this bottling is redolent of baked black cherries, vanilla, smoke and wet riverstones. That fruit-forward style carries over to the palate, with cherry pie and baking spice flavors, backed by a solid and an expertly balanced acidity that holds those rich flavors in check.",93,100.0,California

57290,US,"You'll barely notice a touch of oak on this dry wine. It shows the zesty acidity and varietal purity of all Edna Valley whites, with citrus, lychee, tart green apple and white pepper flavors that stimulate the palate and prepare it for food. A very nice job in a restaurant-style Sauvignon Blanc.",90,18.0,California
57291,France,"Fruity and ripe, the wine also has some solid structure to give it a core of dark tannins. The black-currant fruits are developing well, bringing their crispness to the party. Drink this wine from 2018.",89,14.0,Bordeaux
57292,France,"While the wine is dominated by flavors of wood aging, it also has fine fruit weight that will come through. Then it will be a powerful and concentrated wine, rich and full of blackberry and black plum fruits. The structure will keep this fruitiness in order. Drink from 2017.",90,15.0,Bordeaux
57293,US,"A flinty, earthy aroma and beefy, almost metallic flavors make this an unusual wine. It is full bodied and firm in texture.",83,14.0,California
57294,US,"One of the first 1999 Cabs on the market, this wine smells and tastes like the grapes were crushed yesterday. This is what middleweight Cabernet Sauvignon sans oak tastes like: all fresh blackberries and cherries, with undercurrants of espresso and sweet spice. A remarkably tasty wine that should be easy to find: There were 65,000 cases produced.",86,6.0,California

57297,Chile,"Aromas of mocha, coffee and berry fruit are regular but decent, while the palate is astringent but lively, with herbal red-fruit flavors and a touch of green. Finishes lemony, tangy and grabby, with weight but a slight stickiness.",84,14.0,Curicó Valley
57298,Chile,"Spicy, mildly herbal aromas of cassis and red-berry fruits feed into a racy, fresh palate with vital acidity and excellent overall balance. Flavors of spice and berry fruits are persistent, while the finish is deep and feels right. This blend of Syrah, Cabernet and Carmenère is entirely pleasing. Drink through 2018.",91,30.0,Cachapoal Valley
57299,US,"At a full 91% of the blend, this could be labeled as Cabernet Sauvignon, with Cabernet Franc rounding it out. It's shut down aromatically at present with assorted dried herbs poking through. The palate brings highly structured fruit flavors, with vibrant acidity tying it all together. Decant for a day if drinking in the near term; it will be best after 2022.",91,60.0,Washington
57300,US,"The winery's basic Cab, with no vineyard designation, shares the qualities of the more expensive bottlings. It's dry and tannic and ultraconcentrated in varietal character, with explosive cassis, cherry and new oak flavors. Impresses now for its luxurious mouthfeel, and should develop through 2013.",91,50.0,California
57301,Portugal,"Generous, fruity and rich, this ripe wine has black chocolate flavors to go with its soft tannins and rounded structure. At the end, acidity gives freshness and blackberry-jelly sweetness.",88,12.0,Bairrada

57303,Germany,"Bright, cheery whiffs of sugar cookie crumbs and Meyer lemon zest perfume this sunny off-dry Riesling. On the palate, sweet-tart tangerine mingles into more savory notes of bees wax and pollen. The finish is brisk but refreshing.",89,17.0,Mosel
57304,US,"Lots of dark-fruit flavor, an ultrasmooth texture and a lingering finish raise this medium-bodied and value-priced wine well above average. Black cherry and blackcurrant flavors are sprinkled with spices recalling nutmeg and cardamom.",89,10.0,California

57306,US,"Fermented and aged in stainless steel, this wine is all about fresh, vibrant fruit. Limes, Meyer lemons, gooseberries, Asian pears and something tropical, like papayas, all mingle together. Aging on the lees, which is a popular intervention in many unoaked white wines, gives additional notes of cream and sourdough.",90,15.0,California
57307,US,"Dusty mineral and earth tones lend a savory feel to delicate cherry and red-plum flavors in this pale pink rosé. Bright, fresh raspberry-lemonade acidity bristles on the palate.",84,13.0,New York
57308,France,"This dense and solid wine comes from the eastern ends of the Entre-deux-Mers. It is full of black fruits that balance the firm, dry tannins. Juicy acidity bursts in at the end for a wine that's already delicious and will age well. Best to drink from 2017.",88,10.0,Bordeaux
57309,US,"Grapes from this tiny AVA frequently deliver that something extra that catapults Pinot into a higher dimension. Here, solid cherry and berry tones bear almost indefinable traces of iron, mineral and sweet hay. Delicious already, this should continue to improve through 2020.",94,60.0,Oregon
57310,US,"The Claret is half Cabernet Sauvignon, with the other four Bordeaux grapes filling in the other half, and is quite firm, sappy and muscular. It is tightly structured with cassis, black cherry and plenty of dark, tarry undertones. The herbal aspects show in some black olive and black tea flavors; the tannins are strong and supple, and the wine has a sinuous finish suggesting both strength and length. An exceptional value, this wine should age very nicely.",91,30.0,Washington
57311,France,"This full-bodied perfumed wine brings out ripe white and green fruits. With summer-flower aromas and plenty of acidity, it is attractive and crisply refreshing.",88,19.0,Loire Valley
57312,US,"Cabernet Sauvignon, Petite Sirah and Merlot are all represented in this estate blend that is both brawny and intensely savory. Black pepper and pencil shavings support a tightness of grippy tannin and integrated oak, allowing for only the slightest inkling of fruit in the form of baked plum. This will best be enjoyed 2020–2023.",92,90.0,California
57313,US,"This is a good, sound, everyday Chardonnay. It's very dry and crisp in Central Coast acidity, with mineral-laded flavors of lemons, limes, apples and pineapples, touched with vanilla and buttered toast.",87,18.0,California
57314,US,"So insanely rich and ripe, it's practically a food group in itself. Floods the mouth with blackberry and cherry jam, cassis liqueur, milk chocolate and sweet oak flavors, in a texture that's soft and creamy. It's almost too much of a good thing, and would benefit from a little restraint.",90,150.0,California
57315,US,"A beautiful and lightly spicy nutmeg character lights up this full-bodied wine from the first sniff to the lingering finish. The texture feels very rich, the pear-tart flavors are generous and the spiciness is intriguing. Hints of tannin and tartness firm up the mouthfeel nicely.",91,25.0,California
57316,US,"A wine that suffers somewhat from an abundance of ripe, jammy flavors, this is round and rowdy, completely rich and full, with highlights of coconut, leather and black pepper that persists with power.",87,75.0,California
57317,US,"This blends 20% each of all five red-Bordeaux varieties, showing grapy, plummy flavor that's juicy and soft on the palate. With a core of tobacco, tar and graphite, it complements the fruity with the savory, ending simply and elegantly.",88,75.0,California
57318,US,"Sanguine, dense and thick, this offers an intriguing nose of black pepper and garrigue that conveys a sense of adventure and romance. Its leathery texture never becomes overly weighty, though the fruit and oak are plenty generous. An ideal partner for an equally beautiful steak, its structure suggests time in the cellar will only add to the experience; drink through 2022.",95,150.0,California
57319,France,"Hints of pear perfume the nose on this wine, while the defined palate is bright with lemony freshness. Bundled concentration at the lean, taut core will round out with more bottle age. Drink 2017–2025.",89,36.0,Alsace
57320,Portugal,"A wine that emphasizes the black currant acidity and firm tannins of Cabernet Sauvignon. The fruit layers acidity, wood and some herbs. Age for another year.",87,10.0,Lisboa
57321,Austria,"Very rich, as you might expect from botrytised Chardonnay. It remains surprisingly young, no sign of 11 years' aging, with the acidity coming through freshly over the maple syrup and baked apple flavors. The finish brings the acidity right up front.",88,55.0,Burgenland
57322,Italy,"Underbrush, tobacco leaf and raisin aromas lead the way on this structured wine. The smooth palate delivers black plum, prune, black pepper and exotic spice alongside velvety tannins and surprising freshness for the vintage. It closes on a licorice note.",90,50.0,Veneto
57323,US,"Brawny in tannin weight and grip, this tight-knit wine is impressively built and in tune with the vintage and its embrace of strength and complexity. Chalky texture is highlighted in tart mountain cherry, graphite and vanilla laced in clove. Enjoy best 2023–2033.",91,85.0,California

57325,US,"This is a real cherry bomb, showing terrific concentration and purity of fruit. Those vibrant flavors come in a swath of cola, then dive into a compact finish that leaves a residual hint of chocolate seltzer. This wine seems to be slightly bottle shocked (though it was rested for some weeks after being shipped) and may well deserve a higher score with more bottle age.",92,100.0,Oregon
57326,France,"On 15 acres on the hill above Angélus and under the same ownership, the vineyard is 100% Merlot. This wine is ripe with red fruits, with a structure that shows the chalk soil. Tannins and a dense texture will allow it to develop over the medium-term. Drink from 2019.",90,,Bordeaux
57327,US,"Though quite dark, spicy, smoky, fragrant and seductive, this is a very flavorful wine. Citrusy acids underscore flavors of grapefruit and orange, but the core of the wine is straightforward, pure and ripe berry. It's nice not to fight the fruit with oak; the aromatics are beautiful.",90,28.0,Washington
57328,US,"From a site with elevation rising as high as 2,200 feet, this wine delivers tremendous complexity and minerality, the grapes from volcanic soils. Meaty, with a wisp of smoky char, it's ripe and full bodied in cherry and cassis, nuances of bay leaf and rocky tannin.",92,55.0,California

57330,US,"A blend of fruit from Loess, Mill Creek Upland and Leonetti Old Block, this standout wine opens with alluring aromas of dark chocolate, raspberries, blueberries, sandalwood and assorted spices. The palate is plush and fruit-filled but with well-balanced acidity and impressive length.",92,75.0,Washington
57331,US,"This appellation blend from the single-vineyard-focused winery offers a great look at the region, showing a pithy nose full of Meyer lemon as well as a touch of yogurt. The mouthfeel is grippy with lots of nervous tension, which is much more interesting than the standard range of citrus flavors on display.",91,38.0,California
57332,US,"Oak brings strong buttered toast and vanilla flavors to this Chardonnay. But it's also a powerhouse from the vineyard, with massive orange, pineapple and apricot flavors. May even have some botrytis, to judge from the honeyed sweetness. Yet for all the opulence, the finish is dry.",92,32.0,California
57333,US,"This is not a wine for tonight, or next year, or for at least the next six years. It's shut down in tannins, with an astringency that can't be overcome even with decanting, although that won't stop people from opening it before its time. Buried beneath the tannins are well-developed black currant, roasted meat and cedar flavors that define upscale Napa Cab. Really fine and distinguished, a wine to cellar and enjoy for many years.",95,200.0,California
57334,US,"Sourced from old-vine Bacchus and Weinbau fruit, this also includes 20% grapes from the estate's Heather Hill vineyard.

57335,Italy,"You'll find scents of red berry, chopped herb, clove and a balsamic note on this fragrant Nebbiolo, Vespolina and Croatina blend.

It's elegant and intense but still austere at this stage, with a firm tannic backbone. Drink 2018–2031.",93,55.0,Piedmont
57336,US,"Crafted by Mark McNeilly (Mark Ryan winery), this pure Syrah was cellared in about one third new oak. Tasted shortly after its release, it still showed a bit of a liquorous new oak scent, but without turning up the heat in the finish.

57338,US,"A beautiful Cabernet from this old vineyard, famous in the 1980s for Merlot, which comprises a small amount of the blend.

57342,US,"Big, rich, soft and full-bodied, this 100% Cab impresses for the sheer depth of its blackberries, currants, chocolate and minerals. The inky black color testifies to its extreme youth, as does the freshness of flavor. Nowhere near drinkable now, it wants at least six years, and could be going strong in 2022.",92,140.0,California
57343,France,"A firm wine that is mainly tannin without a great fruit element. It is dry, tight and hard-edged.",84,40.0,Burgundy
57344,France,"A strongly wood-aged wine, firm, spicy and with a burnt edge. Chocolate and black plum-skin fruit combine in this strongly tannic wine. There is, though, a smooth element from the ripe Merlot in the blend, giving potential richness in 2–3 years.",88,,Bordeaux

57347,US,"Black-cherry compote rises on the entry of this wine that's medium in acidity and use of oak, with a punchy sense of sleek, savory fruit and baking spices. Friendly and fleshy, it's a meatier exploration of the variety by the producer, with a rounded, lengthy finish.",91,48.0,California

57351,US,"A generous expression of mountain Cab, accompanied by 14% Malbec, also estate-grown, this rich, soft wine is remarkable for its texture and mouthfeel, which is velvety and smooth.

57352,US,"Does a great job at providing identity to this variety that can often seem a bit muddled. With the structure of a fine Cabernet Sauvignon, it's softer, with more of a red fruit and red currant taste. Feels elegant and distinguished from beginning to end. Drink now.",91,28.0,California

57368,US,"This is the most remniscent of Chablis among Testarossa's new Chardonnays. It's a minerally, chalky wine, bone dry and with lots of acidity, which makes it racy and clean.

With medium body, a velvety texture and flavor complexity, this is the complete Pinot package.",91,40.0,California
57371,US,"The wine is fantastic, albeit tannic. It's not a gushy one to open tonight.

57376,Chile,"Rusty in color, gritty, earthy aromas of mushroom open the aromas of this solid feeling Pinot. The modest acidity makes the palate seem a bit flat, while baked—slightly burnt—flavors of peppered berry fruits finish modest and dry in feel.",86,18.0,Casablanca Valley
57377,US,"A very good Pinot Noir out of Potter Valley, one of inland Mendocino's cooler spots, made by Kenny Likitprakong, who also makes the Hobo and Banyan wines.

57379,US,"This is 100% Syrah from the Boushey vineyard. It's so compact that it's almost impenetrable, but the gorgeous aromas portend a glorious wine given appropriate bottle age and/or breathing time. A dark, dusty mix of black fruits, black olives, black coffee and licorice, this has such density that it's almost impossible to separate out all the fruit layers, let alone the earthier components that make it so distinctive. At 14.8% alcohol, this may be the biggest Betz Boushey Syrah ever.",94,55.0,Washington
57380,US,"A standout among the winery's single-vineyard selections, this big-boned effort brings flavors of chewy cherry alongside a citrus highlight and a definite underpinning of wet stone and clay. Texturally compelling, it should age gracefully through 2024.",93,60.0,Oregon
57381,Chile,"Bell pepper, jalapeño and brined bean aromas straddle the line between snappy/citrusy and vegetal. This has a round palate with weight and punch. Flavors of grapefruit, tangerine, lime and bell pepper hint at vegetal, while the finish is plump and feels fresh.",87,16.0,Leyda Valley
57382,US,"Blackberry and raspberry flavors are ripe and juicy yet invigoratingly crisp in this elegant Bordeaux-style blend.

The cranberry and sour-cherry flavors are concentrated and disclose an intriguing mixture of tart and sweet.",90,15.0,Washington
57393,US,"The RR wines receive special packaging, but little technical information is provided. Though this is a 2013, it's of a piece with the winery's 2014 Pinots, which is to say that lemony acids and a plethora of herbal components overshadow the fruit.

57406,US,"A blend of 60% Montepulciano and 40% Sangiovese, this is a grippy, leathery wine, the fruit sourced from two different sites in the appellation.

57407,US,"With blend of fruit from Gamache (55%), Champoux (33%) and Ciel du Cheval vineyards, the herb, cherry, vanilla, green-tea and green-pepper aromas are followed by bunched-up-seeming tannins. It doesn't appear to have fully ripened.",87,,Washington

57409,US,"This wine is 100% varietal coming from one of the state's most esteemed vineyards. Bright smoke, blackberry liqueur and anise aromas lead full-bodied black-fruit flavors. It brings an unabashed sense of richness, with firm tannins providing support. Give it some time to open up.",92,75.0,Washington
57410,New Zealand,"Unmistakably a Kiwi Pinot Noir, with notes of Dr. Pepper, ripe bramble fruit, oaky spices and tree bark, it loses it's way a little on the palate, lacking the juicy fruit to stand up to all the oak.",87,20.0,Martinborough

57420,US,"Sea salt, Bosc pear, apple cider, squeezed lemon and shreds of vanilla frame a leaner nose on this wine from mid-Monterey County.

57425,France,"A touch of flinty reduction still hangs over the nose, subduing the varietal aromas. But this is only a sign of youth, as is the residual carbon dioxide on the palate. While very young, this holds all it needs for a promising future: A bright core of juicy fruit—think tangerine, tart red apple and ripe yellow pear—as well as the vividly clean and racy freshness of bright lemon. This is concentrated and rather powerful, rapier-like in its cleansing, dry finish but also generous on its fruity midpalate. This is confident and self-assured and stands tall with its powerful structure and body. Leave this to calm down and become itself. Drink 2018–2037.",96,100.0,Alsace

57431,US,"Bright red-fruit tones of hibiscus and pomegranate meet with dried fennel on the complex nose of this bottling from the winery owned by pioneering vintner Louis Lucas and his friend, Judge Royce Lewellen.

57432,US,"Based on Petite Sirah, with small amounts of Syrah and Grenache, this is a huge, fruity, extracted wine.

57435,US,"This complex and distinctive wine is dark and brooding, and reveals itself reluctantly through an elaborate overlay of well-toasted oak.

Best beyond 2008.",92,45.0,California
57436,US,"A blend of Merlot (56%) and Cabernet Franc, this wine opens with aromas of flowers, huckleberry, cardamom and green herbs, along with light barrel accents.

57444,France,"Strong wood-aging flavors give a spice and bitter chocolate character. The result, though, is that the wood softens the potentially stalky fruit and helps accent the underlying red berry flavors with attractive acidity. Drink now.",84,,Bordeaux

57451,Italy,This “classico” interpretation of Nero d'Avola and Frappato from COS is every bit as enjoyable as the producer's top-shelf Pithos expression.

57481,France,"The wannabe Grand Cru of Belzbrunnen has produced this marvellously mature wine. It's fully ripe and shows its perfumed flavors strongly. The acidity is still very present, giving a tight presence to this impressive wine.",91,25.0,Alsace
57482,France,"A soft style of Riesling, with some attractive aromatic white flower character. The fruit is soft, just off dry, freshened by acidity. Screwcap.",87,12.0,Alsace
57483,US,"This wine comes from older vines at Conner Lee, Dionysus and Elephant Mountain vineyards. Light aromas of herb, dark plum, menthol and licorice lead to quite sweet full-bodied fruit flavors and a warm finish. It delivers a sense of hedonism and unabashed appeal, though the variety doesn't seem entirely clear.",89,28.0,Washington
57484,US,"Fruity and front-loaded, with a tongue-tingling mouthfeel. The tasty black cherry fruit quickly fills the mouth with a burst of fresh fruit. The wine is designed for near-term enjoyment.",88,45.0,Oregon
57485,Chile,"Cherry and latex aromas are lean and limited. This feels tight, juicy and jumpy, with raw acidity. Spicy, herbal plum and raspberry flavors lack body on a dry, racy finish.",85,15.0,Casablanca Valley
57486,France,"Particularly intense on the herbaceous front, the wine shows rich grapefruit and lemon zest flavors. Long, deep and delicious.",90,22.0,Loire Valley

57488,US,"This shows classic coastal crispness and delicacy, with a silkiness that makes it feel easy on the palate. It's also delicious in flavors of cherries, bacon, cola and spices. The blend happens to be fattened up by Sangiovese, Tempranillo and Syrah",86,16.0,California
57489,Australia,"A disappointing blend of wine sourced from Mornington and Yarra, this is a bit pale in color, with a Sherried edge to the fruit and some astrigency on the finish.",81,15.0,Victoria

57491,US,"Red chewy fruit that's succulent and satisfying defines this wine that takes a straightforward approach to oak and tannin, integrating them both well. Cherry and cassis linger on the sizable finish.",88,190.0,California
57492,Greece,"Ripe white fruits, Turkish delight and spice lead this complex, aromatic Chardonnay. Balanced on the palate, with layers of peach, citrus and tropical fruit, this is buoyed by fresh acidity. Suitable for fuller-bodied meals, it's also delicious on its own.",91,44.0,Epanomi
57493,US,"Slightly sour orange-cranberry aromas meet with a touch of sagebrush on this wine from an increasingly popular vineyard at the eastern edge of the Sta. Rita Hills. The even-keeled, very drinkable flavors surround tongue-tantalizing spice, light red fruit and a little caramel on the finish.",92,50.0,California
57494,Chile,"Despite the higher price and “reserva” name, this Chard is actually more dull than Terrmater's regular '07 wine, which is innocuous at best. This one is tan and oxidized, with flat, chunky flavors and a dull, melony finish.",81,18.0,Maipo Valley
57495,US,"The dryness and minerality of this wine, combined with its clean, brisk elegance, make it a very nice partner for shellfish. The flavors are lemons, limes, and ripe, crisp white peaches.",89,15.0,California
57496,New Zealand,"Light in body, yet sinewy in texture and a bit sweet, This Riesling has turned out well. Floral, green apple and lime aromas and flavors are almost Mosel-like, but the wine is richer and weightier than that, clocking in at 10% alcohol.",90,28.0,Central Otago
57497,US,"Smells funky, with sweaty leather aromas, although you'll also find varietal notes of the grape. Tastes all right, with blackberries, currants, leather and mocha that are wrapped into firm tannins.",85,45.0,California
57498,US,The main issue with this blend of Cabernet Sauvignon and Syrah is a streak of vegetal unripeness that accompanies the cherries and blackberries. The second problem is excessive softness. Drink up.,82,62.0,California
57499,US,"Made entirely from estate fruit, and given time to settle in French oak puncheons, only a third of them new, this dry and complex white is easily quaffable and yet so much more. Citrus peel and dried herb complement on the nose and palate, with a lightness of being that never veers on frivolous.",92,35.0,California
57500,France,"This is a fragrant, spicy wine that is shot through with red fruits and fine acidity. The 95% Merlot and 5% Cabernet Sauvignon blend is still firm with its tannins although the acidity and bright fruit are well in balance. Drink from 2018.",87,18.0,Bordeaux
57501,US,"This vineyard, often featured in the Sineann lineup, moves over to WildAire for this sensational debut. The blend is a two-clone mix of 777 and Pommard, and it captures a range of delicate, well-defined flavors. Raspberry, cherry, light char, smoke, pepper, bitter herb, vanilla and camomile tea come rolling through. The prime location, which borders on Jadot's Résonance vineyard, contributes a great deal, but the winemaking brings it on home.",94,45.0,Oregon
57502,France,"A hint of smoke and a touch of earth precede the fresh lemon notes of the nose. The dry palate, with its vivid impression of very pure, bright and incisive lemon freshness, still seems tightly wound. There is something brooding and alive about this—it can be felt below the surface, disquieting but promising. This has barely started on its journey and will take a while to develop fully but it's all already there, dormant and ready to unfurl with a little more bottle age. The pure, long and intense finish is a delicious promise. Drink 2017–2037.",95,85.0,Alsace
57503,Italy,"Made with very old, ungrafted vines, this intense wine opens with aromas of toast, leather, espresso, ripe blackberry, spice and tobacco.

57504,US,"There's something magical in the dirt of this vineyard, and it shines extra bright in this bottling. The nose combines cranberry and light pomegranate with a fennel funk. Next, the palate starts with a zing of acidity followed by layers of flavor. Red currant and raspberry morph to cola, mocha and dried lavender, then finish on tart cranberry.",94,49.0,California
57505,Italy,"Made from 80% Sangiovese and 20% Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot, this opens with aromas of tire rubber and sawdust. The lean palate offers espresso and roasted notes but it lacks fruit richness and intensity.",86,23.0,Tuscany
57506,Germany,"Tart white peach and plum notes are fresh and fragrant throughout this crisp, mineral-driven Chardonnay. It's satisfyingly plump in mouthfeel, yet vivacious and crisp on the finish. Drink now through 2016.",89,22.0,Pfalz

57508,Chile,"This is stalky smelling, with rustic aromas of roasted berry, leather, tobacco and eucalyptus. It's full in the mouth, with smacking tannins and firm acids that create a flavor profile of roasted, herbal berry and plum. Bitter chocolate and espresso flavors control the peppery, dry finish. This is a blend of Cabernet Sauvignon, Carmenère and Syrah.",88,70.0,Colchagua Valley

57510,US,"Waves of purple floral fragrance meld with soy, blackberry and roast lamb on the nose of this complex and compelling bottling.

The finish offers a touch of maple syrup.",92,38.0,California

57515,US,"What's nice about this wine is its bone dryness, and the way the acidity scours and cleanses the palate. It's subtle in citrus, grass and hay flavors, with complex herb, spice and mineral complexities. A superior California Sauvignon Blanc, and a superb food wine.",91,28.0,California
57516,Chile,"Briny aromas of lime, jalapeño and minerals filter into a juicy, acidic palate with flavors that match the nose: briny citrus, lime and bell pepper. A narrow feeling finish turns pithy and bitter the longer this sits.",86,20.0,Aconcagua Valley

57518,US,"Dark, big, bold and extracted, this Syrah has tough tannins that are threaded with intricate flavors of blackberry, licorice, pepper, cola and grilled bacon. The astringency will stand up to big, rich roasted and grilled meats, but it doesn't seem likely to make gains beyond the next 3–4 years.",90,60.0,California
57519,US,"Held back and re-released in the spring of 2014, this is smooth and still fruity, the fruit rounding into secondary flavors. Not a big wine, it smoothes out quickly and seems to have a hint of leather, with the finish tailing into a vague fade.",87,65.0,Oregon
57520,US,"This is the brand's first bottling under new ownership, and the result of this blend of Monterey, Sonoma and Santa Barbara county fruit is familiarly ripe—due in part to the inclusion of 10% Merlot, 6% Chardonnay and 2% Syrah. Pomegranate, clove, vanilla and rum aromas lead into a juicy palate of candied red fruit, slate, anise and Earl Grey tea. It's slightly sweet but easily enjoyable.",87,25.0,California
57521,US,"This structured wine is lithe and ethereal in dried herb and cranberry, with a hint of pencil lead. Puckering tannins suggest aging through 2020, to draw out the more succulent layers of black cherry and plum. The wine has 12% Merlot.",91,55.0,California

57527,US,"Unique aromas of lime blossoms, flowering herbs and a tiny bit of jalapeño combine for a fascinating nose on this winery's entry-level offering. There is a slightly bell pepper element on the palate, but it's quite tasty alongside the ripe pears and other familiar flavors.",89,20.0,California
57528,France,"Wonderfully pure notes of mandarin and tart apple on the nose are joined by richer hints of burnt sugar, candied orange and honey. These are shot through with arrows of clean, fresh and pure lemon acidity that highlight the richer, honeyed notes, and also make this wine finish dry. It's full of life and joy.",91,22.0,Alsace

57530,US,"Shea shows some muscle here, yet remains fruit-driven, with a lush midpalate mixing strawberry and raspberry fruit with cola/sassafras soda flavors. In keeping with Boedecker's style, this wine is extremely clean, the fruit is fresh and the flavors nicely detailed. Nothing big or over the top here, but first-class winemaking.",90,45.0,Oregon

57533,France,"Three elements, already in balance, contribute to the success of this wine. First, the rich fruit, juicy blackberry and mulberry, lifted by acidity. Second, the new wood, which spices the fruit but is already smoothing out the third element, the dark firm tannic layer.",89,,Bordeaux
57534,US,"A chef's array of mint, sage and dill accent this small-production wine's savory and smoothly integrated palate. It maintains the integrity of the intensely concentrated vintage. Forest floor, black cherry and black tea flavors contribute additional character.",91,42.0,California
57535,US,"The grapes for this 100% Sauvignon Blanc are sourced from estate American Canyon vineyards as well as an estate plot in Carneros. The result is intense in oaky apple skin and tropical, fleshy lime and guava. Large French oak casks were used for aging.",85,55.0,California
57536,France,"A Blanc de Blancs, from 100% Chardonnay, Deutz's top cuvée in its elegant long-necked bottle has been given enough bottle age from the vintage to bring out a whole raft of complex flavors that are structured finely but are also allowed to express their weight. There are almonds and quince, a texture that is rigorous, but also elegant.",95,,Champagne
57537,Spain,"Everything about this lighter-framed Navarran blend is an echo of when European red wines were racy and crisp as opposed to big, extracted, dark and woody. With fresh raspberry aromas, zesty acidity and earthy flavors of red berry and spice offset by cocoa and vanilla, this is akin to Bordeaux and it should go nicely with most kinds of food.",88,16.0,Northern Spain

57539,France,"This second red wine from the estate was aged in wood for six months. That shows in the smooth character of the ripe Merlot that dominates the blend. The wine is ripe with black-currant jelly fruits that are lifted by the acidity. Drink the wine young, from 2018.",86,19.0,Bordeaux
57540,US,"This release comes from the producer's own Durell Vineyard, specifically two blocks consistently used for this wine. Powerful ripeness and showy fruit rise on the nose and palate first, with an explosion of coconut water and burly oak. The wine was given 15 months in French oak, half of it new.

57554,US,"This new, patriotic Rosenblum Cellars project kicked off with a $100,000 gift to the USO. This affordable but well-manicured wine begins with aromas of caramelized lemon peel and faint peach that carry through to the palate, alongside a lingering note of toasted vanilla.

57555,US,"This is a young yet lush and amazingly rich Pinot Noir. The raspberry and cherry fruit hardly could be riper. Yet the balance of sweet tannins and just-in-time acidity gives the wine good structure. Fine to drink now, and should age well for a couple of years.",90,72.0,California
57556,US,"The 2010 vintage was a generally good one for the winery. Most of the Cabs were released last year, but they've held this Cabernet Sauvignon-Merlot blend back for extra time in the bottle. Yet it's still very tannic, stinging the gums with astringency. Underneath that is a beautiful wine, brimming with fresh blackberries and cassis, and an attractive green-olive note that's sweet and salty and umami-rich. Already throwing some sediment, this is a serious cellar candidate. Don't even think of popping the cork before 2018.",94,90.0,California

57583,US,"It's hard to overstate how deliciously irresistible this wine is, a celebration of the variety that makes a statement of greatness from the first sip to the last.

57588,US,"A touch of 7% Sémillon rounds out this Sauvignon Blanc, the fruit from both Rutherford and Yountville in the heart of the Napa Valley. Subtle on the nose, it offers elegant layers of tart squeezed lemon and a bite of melon.",86,18.0,California
57589,France,"The tannins of this firm wine are softening well to give richness as well as structure. With juicy black currants, it is going to be a solid, dense wine. This is the second wine of the family-owned Grand Pontent which is managed by a member of the Bécot family of classed growth Beauséjour-Bécot. Drink from 2018.",89,45.0,Bordeaux

57591,Germany,"Hints of smoke and toast mingle enticingly amidst ripe black plum and cherry in this rich, lusciously textured wine.

57592,New Zealand,"In 2012, my favorite of the Kumeu River Chardonnays is the medium- to full-bodied, creamy-textured offering from Hunting Hill. Think streusel-topped citrus, but dry, with a long, harmonious finish.",93,49.0,Kumeu

57595,US,"This is one of those Pinot Noirs that demands time in the cellar. Reviewed at slightly more than two years of age, it tastes of fresh young primary fruits, such as cherries, raspberries, blackberries and cola, and the sweet, smoky oak stands out apart. Yet the tannins and acids are outstanding. Give it until mid-2010.",92,75.0,California
57596,France,"Grown on rocky subsoil, this ripe and fruity wine has good acidity and plenty of black-cherry fruit. A darker core of tannins gives the wine a rich texture. With open fruits and plenty of acidity, the wine is developing well. Drink from 2019.",92,60.0,Burgundy
57597,US,"The aromas seem slightly dried out, with notes of dried black raspberry, cigar box, herb, fruit leather, vanilla and barrel spice. The flavors are lightly jammy but at the same time the concentration doesn't all seem to be there. The tannins give a gentle squeeze.",88,25.0,Washington
57598,Germany,"This wine's elevated—for a fruchtig German Riesling—alcohol level (11.5%) and botrytis-influenced flavors of dried apricots and orange marmalade suggest early consumption, although some may want to see if it settles down in another five years.

The 2008 Merlot includes 5% each Cabernet Sauvignon and Cab Franc.

It's a joyride from start to finish.",92,28.0,Washington
57600,US,"Stature is always a Bordeaux blend, but varies in vineyard source each year. This '04 is soft, utterly delicious and fully drinkable now.

57602,Italy,"A blend of 70% Cabernet Sauvignon and 30% Sangiovese, this subdued red discloses aromas of mature, dark-skinned fruit, violet, espresso and allspice.

Nice tart acidity finishes with a hint of sour apple candy on the palate.",84,14.0,New York
57607,Spain,"The previous two years we did not find this wine to be worthy of a rating. This time, we rate it but note that it's an almost-red wine made from Cabernet Sauvignon.

57609,Spain,"This ripe, healthy wine offers aromas of baked black fruits, licorice and raisin. In the mouth, it's more vital than on the nose; racy acidity and firm but pure tannins make sure of that. For flavors, look for savory tomato, plum, berry fruits, licorice and schisty minerality. Finishing notes of mocha, plum and coffee are braced by hard-driving tannins. Drink through 2024.",92,35.0,Catalonia
57610,US,"Nearly opaque in color, the wine offers slight blackberry on the nose with a touch of pie crust. Despite some berry persistence, the flavors lean toward the savory side of Cab, with violet, tobacco and wild game.",85,17.0,California
57611,US,"Winemaker Bill Owen consistently produces one of Washington's most stylish Rieslings. High in acid and low in alcohol, the sweet-tart balance of the wine is exciting and perfectly rendered.

57612,Italy,"This luminous Chardonnay from southern Italy imparts notes of spice, fresh herbs and little fruit. It is, however, rounded off by mineral notes and some citrus or pineapple-like aromas. It's an easy-drinking white with a chalky, almost sweet sensation in the mouth.",86,10.0,Southern Italy

57614,US,"Hearty and plump aromas of plum and mulberry shine above the baked soil and cinnamon elements on the nose of this bottling from the Watsonville area.

57619,France,"Smoky and obviously wood-aged, this toasty, spicy wine has extracted black-coffee flavors that mask the black currant fruits. That leaves a wine that seems austere and with a bitter aftertaste. Drink from 2017.",85,,Bordeaux

57622,US,"The vineyard is in Rutherford, and this 100% Cabernet does show the dusty tannins for which the commune is known. It's also very ripe and exuberant, with tiers of black and red cherry pie, currant and oak flavors, as well as a delicious, earthy note of green olives.

57623,US,"What a delicious Pinot Noir. The cool, long vintage has given it wonderful lightness and acidity, yet also an intensity of fruit that makes it irresistible. Marked by flavors of raspberries, cherries, cola and red currants, it's a wine to savor now, with Pinot-friendly foods such as lamb and steak.",92,59.0,California

57625,Germany,"Intentionally skewed toward the drier side of kabinett, this is an impressive effort from proprietor Raimund Prüm. It's light in body, with fairly ripe fruit flavors of honeyed apple and a hint of apricot, yet intensely refreshing thanks to crisp acidity. Drink now.",89,19.0,Mosel
57626,US,"This wine is a blend of fruit from five different vineyards scattered across the valley. The aromas of barrel spice, black cherry, dried leaves, herbs and flowers still seem quite locked up. The flavors are generous and full with palate coating milk chocolate and cherry flavors with a finish that lingers.",89,38.0,Washington
57627,Argentina,"Earthy, leathery, stewed aromas are more savory than fruity. The palate on this Malbec-led blend is full, flush and resiny. Savory blueberry, Middle Eastern spice notes and oaky flavors reside in front of a roasted finish with grab and grip.",89,37.0,Mendoza Province
57628,US,"This superripe wine is a blast of blackberry, cherry and blueberry fruit, puréed in the blender and then sprinkled with a dusting of cocoa and white pepper. But it's too sweet by far, and too soft, lacking the structure for balance.",83,28.0,California
57629,Chile,"This is an earthy, somewhat flat wine with herbal berry aromas that fall away in quiet form. A full, grabby palate brings berry, raisin and tobacco flavors, all supported by a modest beam of acidity. A finish of earth, tobacco and mulchy flavors announce that 2009 was indeed a hot vintage in Chile.",88,30.0,Maule Valley
57630,Italy,"Made with Nerello Mascalese and 5% Nerello Cappuccio, this structured but elegant wine opens with aromas of underbrush, mature black fruit and graphite.

57632,US,"Plump blueberries, slate, gravel, turned earth and a light fennel character show on this wine, which comes in a custom bottle exclusive to the appellation's estate-grown Syrahs. The palate shows a lively acidity that briskly expresses the black pepper, black currant and espresso flavors.",90,29.0,California

57634,US,"Notes of honeysuckle, white peach and fresh green herb are intensely aromatic. This off-dry effort balances zippy, lemon-lime acidity with layers of ripe, rich fruit. It's lushly textured, yet it finishes delicately with a bristle of white-tea astringency.",88,19.0,New York
57635,France,"This wine has the proper power and structure of Gevrey, with firm tannins under the ripe red berry and cherry fruits. There is great juicy acidity as well as a firmer structure that will let the wine age. Drink from 2017.",90,,Burgundy
57636,US,"The old vine designation, though unregulated, is usually reserved for plantings at least a quarter century old. Though the first sniff suggests a wine that has been over-oaked, such is not the case. It has the concentration and fruit power—layers of citrus and stone fruit flavors—along with the depth and texture that older vines bring, to more than support the generous new oak.",90,78.0,Oregon
57637,Italy,"Aromas of violet, underbrush, graphite, mature dark fruit and Asian spice lead the nose on this blend of 65% Cabernet Sauvignon, 20% Merlot and 15% Sangiovese.

57641,Chile,"Clean and fresh, and also varietally correct as it unloads full but accurate aromas of cucumber, passion fruit and lime. Casas del Bosque does very well with Sauvignon Blanc. This wine has all the citrus, tang and style you could ask for, but it shows good depth and complexity as well, which is what pushes it up to the next level. For $14, this wine delivers plenty.",89,14.0,Casablanca Valley

57645,Chile,"Blackberry, black pepper, herb, olive and mint aromas are draped over the nose of this blend of 50% Cabernet Sauvignon, 40% Syrah and 10% Carmenère.

57646,Austria,"A real mix of dark and red fruit is presented here: tart red cherry, along with some rhubarb, blueberries and cranberries.

57651,US,"Thea's Selection book-ends the single-vineyard wines and is the winery's lower-priced, multi-vineyard blend. As with the Jerome, the flavors are more complex and woven than in the single-vineyard bottlings; with cherry and berry fruit, fresh herb and streaks of bitter chocolate. It's a complete, supple wine, with no holes, moderately ripe fruit, and just a hint of heat in the finish.",88,32.0,Oregon
57652,France,"Taut and mineral, this is currently a wine that is waiting to reveal its power and majesty. The fruit is on a tight rein of acidity, which only slowly opens up to show mango, pineapple, crisp citrus, layers of toast and a mouth-enveloping richness. Age for at least five years, preferably 10.",97,574.0,Burgundy
57653,France,"Satisfyingly ripe wine, now approaching maturity. It has just the right weight from the black currant fruits, the more mature leather texture and the firm tannins that give a dry core. The wine could age for several more years, but is ready to drink now.",90,30.0,Bordeaux
57654,US,"Made predominantly from the winery's best barrels of Cabernet Sauvignon, this blend also contains Malbec, Merlot and Petit Verdot. Game, cinnamon, burly, brambly blackberry and tar are robustly wound around a big-boned structure, with hints of vanilla and smoke.",90,115.0,California

57662,US,"The vineyard could qualify for a Sonoma Coast appellation, being in a very cool location. The vintage also was a chilly one. The resulting wine is not opulent.

57691,US,"Made by Kirk Venge from a Dutton Ranch vineyard site, this wine immediately offers a lot to like, from its earthy sassafras and compelling layers of crisp raspberry and cherry, to its soft layers of oaky density accented in rose. Requiring more time to open, with an ideal cellaring through 2023, it finishes with a flair of cedar and vanilla, lasting long on the palate.",94,68.0,California
57692,US,"This first wine of the vintage, a blend of Pinot Noir, Grenache, and Valdigue, is largely the result of carbonic maceration, a winemaking technique that creates the freshest, sharpest, zingiest aromas and flavors imaginable. ItÕs vibrant and juicy, like Beaujolais. The gorgeous ripeness of the fruit bodes well for the 2001 vintage. Great value.",86,8.0,California
57693,Chile,"Coffee, herbal berry and a light whiff of green herbs announce a solid, well-built wine, with flavors of olive, herbs, plum and blackberry. The finish is smooth, healthy, and a bit toasty.",87,12.0,Maipo Valley
57694,US,"Ripe grass scents meet with green pear, dill, thyme and gooseberries on the nose of this vivacious wine.

57695,Germany,"Lavish aromas of tropical fruit and caramelized sugar abound on this boldly fruity Riesling. It's sweet-tart tangerine and stone-fruit flavors also pack a punch on the palate. Swirls of sweet honey on the midpalate are offset by nervy streaks of acidity and a salty, tangy minerality that lingers on the finish.",92,45.0,Mosel
57696,New Zealand,"Ever get served a grapefruit half topped with a maraschino cherry? That's kind of what this wine smells like. So it's a bit confected, but pleasant, with hints of currant and citrus, with a slightly sweet-and-sour finish.",86,14.0,Marlborough
57697,US,"Lots of ripe fruit in this wine, offering rich flavors of raspberries, cherries, persimmons and red plums, with a tart note of cranberry. Tastes fresh, lively, and rather young. Drink over the next six years.",91,78.0,California
57698,South Africa,"This is a ripe and seductive Chardonnay, with great opulence to the palate and lush fruit characteristics of red-apple flesh, clove-spiked orange and creamy pear. Hints of toasted challah and sweet spice add depth and interest, while ample acidity keeps the generous mouthfeel in line and the finish clean.",88,19.0,Elgin
57699,US,"A very good, delicious Chardonnay that's easy to drink, and whose richness suggests shrimp, scallops, lobster and similarly rich fare. Dry and crisp in acidity, it wows with pineapple marmalade, crème brûlée, buttered toast, vanilla, honeysuckle and mineral flavors, brightened with zesty acidity.",92,55.0,California
57700,US,"Gamy roast lamb aromas meet blueberry and crushed bay leaf on the nose of this bottling—a shining example of Syrah from southern Santa Clara County. White pepper, thyme and graphite notes show on the palate, where a core of elderberry fruit core is enhanced by that feral, gamy quality.",91,50.0,California
57701,US,"Nicely made and expressive of a full range of AVA-specific flavors, this well-priced Pinot Noir shows off the unique attributes of Oregon's cooler vintages. Scents and flavors of beet root, rosewater and fresh strawberries occupy center stage. It doesn't over-reach, and brings these disparate elements into harmony.",88,22.0,Oregon
57702,US,"Hints of smoke and nut lend a savory tone to fresh pear and yellow peach on this dry, full-bodied Riesling. Textured and expansive on the palate, it's brightened by a splash of white-grapefruit acidity. Finishes moderately long.",85,16.0,New York
57703,Israel,"Dark red violet in color, this wine offers a nose of black cherry, brambles and violet. Teamwork between fruit and cool herb flavors is evident amid notes of red cherry, toffee, fennel bulb and mint. Mouth-coating tannins give way to a zest-laden finish.",91,17.0,Galilee
57704,Austria,"V.T.S.? Vintage Top Select is the name of this blend of Cabernet Sauvignon, Cabernet Franc, Blaufränkisch, Zweigelt, Merlot and Syrah. Quite a collection, but the result is a finely polished wine, new wood topping a concentrated, lightly jammy texture, which has richness and good ripe redfruit flavors. A finishing bitterness, which needs to soften out, is the only downside here.",89,36.0,Burgenland
57705,US,"“Swan Song” indicates that this is the last vintage of Cabernet to be produced from this vineyard block. So enjoy it while it's here: There's plenty of dry black cherry, licorice, cola and smoked meat, and dusty tannins with nice grip close the show. Our critique is that this is an excellent finalé.",90,39.0,California
57706,US,"The vineyard sourcing here is half Le Bon Climat and half Bien Nacido. It's a fleshy, flashy Chardonnay, big and opulent, if a little obvious in crowd appeal. Shows rich, flamboyant pineapple, honey, vanilla, crème brûlée and buttered toast flavors.",88,35.0,California
57707,US,"The palate is subdued with modest apple and lemon notes, but brisk lemon-lime acidity and a hint of white florals adds some complexity. Dry and full bodied on the palate, it's an easy white to accompany everyday dinners of fish or chicken.",84,25.0,New York

Full but balanced with medium acidity and soft, approachable tannins. The finish offers a sweet smoked-vanilla flavor.",88,65.0,Galil
57709,Chile,"Melon, wood spice and vanilla aromas are common for this level of Chilean Chardonnay. A plump palate is low on acidity, while this tastes of pear, oak and skins-based bitterness. A woody tasting finish is adequate.",85,15.0,Colchagua Valley
57710,Chile,"Blueberry and raspberry aromas are front and center along with a hint of animal hide. In the mouth, this is bullish, ripe and generous, with oak-rich flavors of vanilla, baked berry fruit and spice. Licorice, latent oak and heat work the finish on this ripe specimen. Among Chilean Syrahs, this is a perennial pack leader.",91,86.0,San Antonio

57712,France,"Now owned by Château Haut-Bailly, this wine was produced before the purchase. It is elegant and ripe; its tannins already well integrated, resulting in a full-bodied yet fruity character. Black plum and dark spice notes are lightened with refreshing acidity on the finish. Age for five years and more.",91,80.0,Bordeaux
57713,France,"Initially a very soft wine, it slowly shows its ripe fruits, intense texture and blend of buttery toast and acidity. Yellow fruits dominate, bursting through the acidity to give a ripe, opulent finish. Age for 3–4 years.",91,120.0,Burgundy
57714,US,"Dijon and Pommard clones blend gracefully here, pushing sweet cherry fruit and baking spices into the flavor center. A touch of fresh-baked pie crust lingers also, and this easy-drinking cuvée should be enjoyed now through 2020.",90,55.0,Oregon
57715,Spain,"The nose on this wine is condensed and tight, with snappy berry aromas that come across fresh. The palate feel is lively and juicy, while flavors of plum, berry and tobacco are honest and appealing. Straightforward and convincing as a whole, with a solid structure. Drink now through 2017.",89,35.0,Northern Spain
57716,Chile,"Jammy berry aromas are touched up in a good way by spicy notes of good oak and chocolate. A solid, ripe palate feels right and balanced. Mellow but thorough berry fruit and oak flavors linger easily on a finish with chocolate and muted oak notes. Drink through 2022.",91,35.0,Maipo Valley
57717,US,"This is a slightly riper approach from the longtime producer, with browned butter, vanilla, honeyed pineapple and a hint of seared marshmallow on the nose. The palate shows ripe brown pears and caramelized apples that carry deep into the finish. It's a balanced take on this style, never over the top.",93,38.0,California
57718,US,"High alcohol gives this Bordeaux-Rhône blend a sweet, hot mouthfeel, while overripe fruit suggests raisins and prunes. Still, it's a sound wine that will find plenty of admirers. Ready now.",83,60.0,California
57719,US,"From the rocky, volcanic soils of Durell, this white is exuberant in salty rock and sea spray, showing plenty of influence from the Pacific Ocean to its west.

57720,US,"Coconut scents convene around ripe purple fruits—blueberry and plum—which abound here. Lovely and seductive, this has the potential for long-term aging, which should bring additional layers of complexity. Drink now through 2028.",92,45.0,Oregon
57721,France,This is a full-bodied rosé with soft red berry and tart cherry flavors intertwined with notes of white chocolate. The finish could last a bit longer. Drink up.,84,16.0,Languedoc-Roussillon
57722,US,"Big and bold, this emphasizes flavor impact. Attractively deep in hue, it stays ruby-colored and fresh-looking at the rim. An oak influence shows in the vivid vanilla and light maple syrup aromas and carries over to the flavors that show a vein of ripe berry fruit, too. Full bodied and velvety in texture, it has ample tannins that help carry flavors to the finish.",92,85.0,California
57723,US,"A pure and distinctive fruit flavor, like a blend of rhubarb and blackberry, distinguishes this full-bodied but elegant and velvet-textured wine. There is little or no new oak influence to get in the way of the melody of the grapes themselves. While the wine is lush and broad in mouthfeel, a nice boost of fine tannins and fresh acidity keep it lively.",92,38.0,California
57724,US,"The hot climate of the Cold Creek Vineyard sharpens up the contours of this Chardonnay, which shows more of a classic Washington character. Bright fruit, a mix of apples and peaches and pears, is shot through with streaks of butterscotch from fermentation in new French oak. It's been through 100% malolactic, yet retains some crispness. Polished and full-bodied.",89,20.0,Washington
57725,US,"As Willamette Valley vintners continually improve and redefine Oregon Chardonnay, a distinctive profile is emerging. This vivid and taut mineral-driven wine could be the poster child. The citrus, apples and pears bring a light touch of baking spices, extended length and surefire ageability. Plus, it's a fine value for a wine of such quality.",93,34.0,Oregon
57726,France,"Firm and tense, this is a wine on the high wire. The tannins are stretched with acidity, the berry fruits and red cherry flavors vividly standing out against this structure. The aftertaste is fine, poised, mineral. This is developing into an important wine.",92,55.0,Burgundy
57727,US,"Orange peel and raspberry aromas meet a touch of sourness on the nose of this bottling from Joey Tensley and Alex Guarachi, which comes after the label's more successful red and white wines. The palate maintains good acidity and grip, with berry compote and earthy flavors.",86,20.0,California

57729,Israel,"Attractive and layered with a blueberry and raspberry fruit core accented by notes of sweet spice, orange oil, ashy tobacco and a touch of dark purple florals.

57730,Italy,"The winemaking efforts of Lazio (the region that houses the Italian capital, Rome) are slowly being noticed thanks to an admittedly small group of quality-minded producers. This Syrah shows ripe fruit and soft roundness with elements of prune, coffee and cherry liqueur.",87,15.0,Central Italy
57731,US,"Right out of the starting blocks this is an oaky wine, dripping with caramel and vanilla notes. The texture on the midpalate is finessed and graceful, with drying tannins that latch onto the oak-driven finish. An eccentric blend of 50% Tannat, 35% Petit Verdot and 15% Pinotage.",86,40.0,Virginia
57732,Italy,"This blend of 50% Merlot and 50% Cabernet opens with earthy aromas reminiscent of mature black plums, along with whiffs of farmyard and wet fur.

57733,Germany,"Hints of bramble and earth lend savory nuances to sunny yellow peach and melon flavors in this bright vivaciously crisp Kabinett. Off-dry in style, it's balanced by a stream of focused tangerine acidity leading from midpalate through a moderately long finish. Start drinking now.",89,28.0,Mosel

57737,Austria,A closed nose hints nonetheless at some concentration. The palate reveals yellow plum held tight by citrus freshness. This is whistle-clean and holds charming nuances of grapefruit and peach. Drink now or wait until 2016–2017; more fruit may come to the fore.,91,21.0,Kremstal
57738,US,"This is complex and compelling. A spicy, minty, thyme-like character comes out in the aroma and continues in the flavor, most likely from some new barrels used in aging the wine. It's an attractive characteristic, and complements the bright cherry flavors, medium body and quite firm tannins.",89,25.0,California
57739,US,"A very awesome array of burnt bacon, dried violets, chipped asphalt and tart elderberry show on the nose of this bottling from a remote vineyard north of the Santa Maria Valley.

57740,US,"A light golden hue, this richly aromatic wine offers notes of toasty barrel spices, apricot and dried mango. It's full bodied, almost unctuous in feel, with abundant, sweet stone-fruit flavors and a lingering finish.",90,28.0,Washington
57741,US,"The Dion is a new entry in the long list of Erath single-vineyard wines. It doesn't show much in this difficult vintage. Short and intensely herbal, it has strong scents and flavors of tomato leaf, which override any hint of ripe fruit flavor.",85,50.0,Oregon
57742,US,"One of the greatest Chardonnays made in California each vintage, this bottling blends riper elements of yellow peach and honey with the tension of tangerine rind and pink-grapefruit pith on the nose.

57743,Spain,"Firm aromas of black plum, black cherry and sugar beet give way to power and lots of body on the palate. This delivers the goods in the form of chocolate and herbal berry flavors, which are backed by minty, dry oak notes on the finish.",88,9.0,Levante
57744,US,"Vibrant lavender, as well as the flowering tips of rosemary and thyme, meet with blueberry on the floral nose of this wine that shows little of the tarry harshness that often comes from the grape. Lavender also marks the sip, as does white pepper, crushed thyme, dried mint, sage and even tarragon, atop a dark purple-fruit backbone.",89,28.0,California
57745,US,"Mostly Lemberger, from a 1979 planting, this is an explosion of sweet berry and milk chocolate—what's not to like? Luscious and full across the palate, it's a raspberry truffle in a bottle. Not sweet, so not for dessert, but in a way it is dessert all by itself.",89,18.0,Washington
57746,US,"Drier and better structured than your typical Paso Robles Cab, this polished wine shows an earthy, herbal edge to the cherry, blackberry and cedar flavors. Shows a Bordeaux-like finesse and elegance that's all too rare in Cabernet from this appellation.",91,39.0,California
57747,France,"91-93 Deliciously fresh wine, the acidity striking to the core of the balanced tannins. The texture is dusty, firm, preserving elegance.",92,,Bordeaux

57752,South Africa,"This Pinotage-dominant blend is a bit closed to begin, but opens up after some time in the glass to reveal enticing notes of dark berries, plums and whole vanilla beans.

57753,France,"This is a richer style of Blanc de Blancs that has the weight of a high dosage behind it. There's a baked-apple character that's rich and rounded, but laced with minerality as well. It's soft on the palate, but with a reverberating freshness.",90,,Champagne
57754,US,"The Hope family dives into Chardonnay with this sleek bottling. The nose is tight with pink-grapefruit pith, unfurled white flowers and crushed seashells.

57755,Australia,"For a wine that didn't go through malolactic fermentation, this is thickly textured, almost pulpy, lacking a bit of vibrance. The pineapple fruit is weighty, but one-dimensional.",83,20.0,South Australia
57756,France,"This wine is soft, indistinct at this stage. It needs to develop more of the fruitiness that is behind the bland exterior. The aftertaste has good freshness.",84,,Burgundy
57757,US,"Tolosa may be the only vineyard to produce two unoaked Chardonnays in the same vintage. Their '11 Central Coast is quite good. This one, from estate Edna Valley fruit, is even better.

Ideal across a wide variety of foods.",91,24.0,California
57769,US,"This is one of the Russian River Valley's bigger, riper Pinots. The rich raspberry and cherry flavors are reminscent of a dessert pastry, yet it's dry, silky and bright in acidity. Gains in the glass as it breathes, so give it a brief decant and drink now–2015.",90,45.0,California

The body is light and spicy and has a touch of fragrant conifer and an abundance of lovely unforced cranberry and red cherry.

57778,US,"Made in a cool part of Napa Valley in a cool vintage, this Syrah is very dry and tough in youthful tannins. It's too astringent to offer much pleasure now, but has a great heart of ripe blackberry, dark chocolate, leather, tobacco, anise and pepper flavor that should sweeten and emerge as the wine ages. Try holding until after 2009.",88,40.0,California

57898,US,"This blend of Cabernet Sauvignon (43%), Merlot (31%), Petit Verdot (12%), Cabernet Franc (9%) and Malbec was assembled after just a little more than a year in barrel and then aged for an additional year in 500-liter French oak puncheons. It's 85% free-run juice and locked up with notes of graphite, dark chocolate, cassis and wood. The flavors are elegant, tart and tightly coiled, surrounded by chewy tannins that still need some time in the bottle to be tamed.",91,105.0,Washington
57899,France,"The wine shows the firm tannins of the vintage. They give a dry core that will probably remain. However, there is also a fine layer of fresh black-currant fruit that gives a fine lift to the wine at the end. It will be ready soon, drink from 2017.",89,40.0,Bordeaux
57900,France,"There is plenty of ripe fruit here, the richness of 2005 evident. The flavors are of ripe blackberry jam, red plums and a strong structure of sweet tannins. There is a fresh, acidity-driven juicy lift on the finish.",87,15.0,Bordeaux
57901,Portugal,"Catty and grassy this is a very Sauvignon style of Sauvignon. It is tight, herbal and intense with a cool climate character that comes from the proximity of the Atlantic Ocean to the vineyards. Drink now.",86,17.0,Lisboa
57902,Argentina,"Leathery berry aromas are earthy and suggest notes of cured meat and cheese. It gets tougher and more tannic the more it breathes, with black fruit, herb and spice flavors. Generous but rough in feel, it has a powerful, medium-long finish.",85,12.0,Mendoza Province

57904,US,"A mad scientist's blend of 32% Syrah, with smaller amounts of Petit Verdot, Cabernet Sauvignon, Cabernet Franc, Petite Sirah and “other,” this wine is rustic, with a thin palate and not much in the way of fruit.",83,24.0,California

57906,Germany,"Whiffs of saffron and spice lend earthen complexity to cutting lime and green plum in this zesty Riesling. Off dry on the palate, it's delicately sheer and spry. Its invigorating style is pleasurable already, but should only meld and improve from now through 2022.",90,38.0,Mosel
57907,US,"Aromas of fines herbes, chocolate and licorice follow through onto the medium- to full-bodied palate, which displays balanced acids and finessed tannins.",88,21.0,Virginia
57908,France,"A well constructed, solid wine, this has a fine layer of firm tannins that melds well with the rich black plums and acidity. Even this young, the wine is showing a balanced character, warm and ripe. It will age, so drink from 2018.",90,35.0,Bordeaux
57909,US,"A barrel-fermented Chardonnay with creamy texture, this opens with bright, prominent Meyer lemon notes before delving into softer flavors of pear and vanilla on the midpalate. The acidity holds through to the finish, accented by a touch of honey.",90,35.0,California

57911,US,"This is an ambitious, Super Tuscan-esque blend of 60% Sangiovese, 30% Cabernet Sauvignon 10% and Petit Verdot. It shows woody cedar, violet flowers and dense purple fruit on the nose. Tongue-tingling acidity enlivens the palate, which offers good tension between blackberry juice and tarry grip.",89,45.0,California
57912,France,"Full and ripe, certainly as befits Meursault from a great year, but this wine also has deliciously crisp acidity which adds an element of minerality, of poise, to the smooth toast and cream texture. An enticing, structured wine.",90,80.0,Burgundy

Will undoubtedly age. Best now through 2011, at least.",92,50.0,California
57917,Argentina,"Salmon in color and made from Cabernet Franc, this rosé is full of bursting nectarine and light citrus aromas. That's followed by a thick, almost syrupy palate with fruitcake, peach and caramel flavors. Full-flavored and full-bodied; drink immediately.",86,,Mendoza Province

57919,Chile,"A touch neutral on the nose, but overall this is a nice, minerally, grassy SB with lots of green apple and freshness. The palate offers depth and clarity, and the flavors of green fruits are good. Falls off on the finish, which seems flat compared to the rest of the wine.",88,12.0,Casablanca Valley
57920,US,"One of Oregon's best-kept secrets is this well-made budget-priced Pinot from Eola Hills. Aged in French and American oak for just under one year, it's labeled as a plain Oregon AVA, but it's 95% Willamette Valley fruit. That brings an extra dimension to the wine, with some tannic muscle and a streak of dried leaf and forest floor flavors along with ripe strawberry fruit.",88,19.0,Oregon
57921,US,"This wine never saw any oak. What you get is what the grapes contributed, which is pure, intense tangerine and lime fruit, brightened with brisk acidity. It's a chiseled wine, but there's a streak of honey that relieves it.",86,20.0,California
57922,Spain,"A big, warm, baked wine made from Merlot, Garnacha, Syrah and Cab Sauvignon. It has baked aromas in front of a full, balanced palate that hits with dark fruit, molasses and warmth. Does a good job of blending ripe black fruit and chocolate with proper tannins and acidity. Drink now.",88,15.0,Catalonia
57923,Spain,"At first the aromas of hard cheese and blatant oak veil the black fruit quotient in this blend.

It doesn't appear to have much depth or complexity, but overall it is smooth and pleasant.",86,56.0,Northern Spain

57925,France,"This wine has an initial strong tannic element that submerges the red fruits. As it opens, the wine reveals more juiciness, berry flavors and fresh acidity. It's still young and needs to be aged. Drink from 2018.",87,30.0,Loire Valley
57926,Israel,"With fairly muted fruit flavors and a hint of green pepper, this lighter-bodied and easy-drinking wine will pair well with most meat or chicken entrées. Flash-pasteurized and mevushal, this is a blend of 50% Cab, 30% Merlot and 20% Shiraz.",84,10.0,Galilee
57927,France,"Dark colored wine, revealing wood aging both aromatically and to taste. That said, it also has great weight, a powerful and complex wine with its coffee, dried fruit and black plum flavors. It's an impressive, solid wine that deserves at least seven years' aging.",91,29.0,Bordeaux
57928,US,"Too much oak on this Chardonnay. It's dominated by the aromas and flavors of buttered toast and caramelized, vanilla accented wood. Underneath all that are some pretty good pineapple, peach and pear flavors.",86,35.0,California
57929,US,"A tight, brambly field-like blend of Carignane, Petite Sirah, Zinfandel and Alicante Bouschet, this black, dense and mouth-coating wine offers savory leather and spice.

57930,US,"Marked by a great big burst of ripe fruit, this Merlot is distinctly New World in origin. You can taste the sunshine in the purity of the blackberry, cherry and plum flavors. With complex but soft tannins, it's so polished, you can drink it by itself.",90,40.0,California
57931,US,"Typically the most forward of the winery's offerings, this wine brings aromas of blue fruit along with notes of fire pit, olive, mineral and cured meat that become more prominent over time. The blue and black-fruit flavors are dense and focused, with a firm backbone of tannins providing support. It needs time in the cellar to stretch its legs.",91,39.0,Washington
57932,Austria,"Inviting hints of crushed blueberry and blackberry show the slightest overtones of smoke. The palate is smooth, with still slightly crunchy but ripe tannins that provide a pleasant framework for the refreshing berry fruit. A ripe, appetizing medium-bodied red with a welcome streak of freshness.",89,60.0,Carnuntum
57933,France,"A beautiful, pure wine that  combines freshness and intense richness. It seems to float while still giving a huge mouthful of plums, coffee and sweet, juicy tannins. A straight line of pure flavor all the way to the finish.",98,,Burgundy
57934,US,"The Meyer Vineyard, in the Red Hills of Dundee, ripened especially well in 2006, bringing forth concentrated fruits that mix raspberry, cranberry, pie cherry and finishing hints of rhubarb. Spice and sharp acids add definition to the midpalate, and the careful barrel aging has introduced accent notes of nutmeg, licorice and black tea. Despite its heft and substantial 14.6% alcohol, this wine has a sleekness that carries it gracefully into a lengthy, elegant finish.",91,48.0,Oregon
57935,France,"This has good balance among its ripe blackberry and red-plum flavors and its firm core. It's solid and chunky while also offering crisp, taut acidity. The aftertaste, with a touch of smokiness, is attractive.",87,,Bordeaux
57936,US,"A great Hanzell Chardonnay, which means you don't want to drink it now. Dry and acidic, it's an aloof young wine whose minerality gives it a tough tang of steel despite a heart of citrus fruit. Give it 5–6 years in a good cellar, and it will develop interestingly beyond that.",93,70.0,California
57937,US,"You'll find lots to like in this dry, stylish Cabernet. It's full-bodied and tannic, but you can drink it now for the wealth of blackberry, black currant, cola, mineral and oak flavors.",87,28.0,California
57938,US,"This is a decadently rich Chardonnay, although it depends for its appeal mainly on oak and ripe fruit, rather than nuance. Explodes with pineapple jam, golden mango, crème brûlée, buttered toast, honey and cinnamon spice flavors. Ready now.",88,32.0,California
57939,US,"Milk chocolate and pomegranate curiously mix in this mid-weight, lowly oaked nonvintage Cabernet, blended with 18% Merlot and 2% Petite Sirah. New American oak aged most of it, with a bit of French, too, only 25% of the whole new.",87,28.0,California
57940,US,"In a challenging vintage, this shows excellent structure around rather light fruit. Strawberry and cherry come into play, with some well-managed tannic strength from the addition of Cabernet Sauvignon, Cab Franc and a splash of Malbec.",88,25.0,Washington

57942,US,"The least-expensive designate is also one of Sokol Blosser's best in 2012. After opening with a whiff of funk supported with a flinty hint of clay, it moves into a complex palate with both grip and definition. The acid component brings flavors of sweet citrus and orange peel, while the overall structure and pretty red fruits suggest that this is a wine to cellar. Drink now through 2024.",92,38.0,Oregon
57943,Austria,"Red apple and grapefruit zest are softly evoked on the nose. That same juicy combination plays on the light-bodied, dry palate. A zesty texture adds interest and crunch. The finish is clean and very refreshing.",90,24.0,Kamptal
57944,US,"A bit of bottle age always makes for a more compelling Pinot Noir, in this case showing kirsch, clove, leather and turned earth on the nose. There is a richness to the palate, full of black cherry and fig flavors, as well as an earthy undercurrent of thyme, anise and eucalyptus that rises toward the finish.",93,42.0,California

57947,US,"This is the best Potelle Syrah I've ever had, but be forewarned: It's an extraordinarily tannic wine that shows its 1,800-foot mountain origins. It clocks in at 13.9% alcohol, yet it's bone dry. The fruit is powerfully concentrated in blackberries enhanced with sweet, smoky oak. If ever there was a Syrah for the cellar, this is it. Best now (if you like young tannic wines, but please decant) and for at least eight years, as it gradually mellows.",93,75.0,California
57948,South Africa,"The assertive elegance of a French Bordeaux is present here, but the Fusion also has a South African edge to it that gives it extra appeal. The nose, a subtle layering of luscious berry, minerality and spice, rolls into a clean, taut but flirty combination of plum and pepper, edged very quietly by tobacco smoke. Serious but with a feminine touch, this wine is made for food pairing.",91,45.0,Stellenbosch
57949,Spain,"This wine smells baked and rasiny, and the bouquet brings charcoal and toast notes into play. It feels mature and ready, with raisin, molasses, chocolate and rooty berry flavors.

57953,US,"Baking spice and vanilla aromas are at the fore, followed by blue fruit and barrel spices. The barrel influence (71% new French and American) leads on the palate as well, with abundant vanilla flavors that wash over the fruit. There's some good fruit underneath, if you can get to it.",87,30.0,Washington

57955,Chile,"Jammy berry aromas seem reduced at first, with notes of iodine and rubber. But with airing this packed Syrah comes around.

57957,US,"Full, with lots of structure, this offers concentrated grape and blackberry aromas that open to black-currant and cedar-spice flavors. A fine fruit-acid balance on the full, even palate keeps it lively, even in its fairly youthful and closed state. Dusty tannins and sweet-and-sour black fruits on the long but tight finish close this appealing package.",92,44.0,California

57959,France,"This wine is structured with impressively ripe fruit. Black-plum juice and blackberries are balanced with a strong tannic content that gives the wine backbone and structure. It has weight, although with its already exuberant fruitiness, it is not likely to be really long-term wine. Drink from 2024. From 120 acres, only the best grapes go into this top wine and 2013 was a smaller crop than the average (10,000 to 12,000 cases). Believed to be the oldest of the five Bordeaux first growths, Haut-Brion has been in the Clarence Dillon family since 1935. The current president is Prince Robert de Luxembourg.",95,365.0,Bordeaux

57962,US,"This wine has a deep pink color with a touch of amber, and very bright and zingy aromas. Mouthwatering, crisp fruit flavors are full of citrus and cherry. The lively texture is due to great grape acidity that lights up this wine.",89,24.0,California
57963,France,"Produced in the hills above the small town of Castillon, the wine is fruity with a stalky texture and some firm tannins. It is balanced, though, with its acidity and black-currant flavors and should mature well over the next few years. Drink from 2018.",88,25.0,Bordeaux
57964,US,"Coming from a single block of the winery's estate vineyard, it has notes of cranberry, black pepper, herbs and moist earth speckled with oak spices (30% new French). The palate has soft, sleek cherry flavors buffeted by firm tannins.",88,50.0,Oregon
57965,Germany,"Lithe and dainty in profile, this late-harvest Riesling seems to dance on the nose and palate, with sweet notes of fresh apple, grapefruit and blossoms. It's intensely mineral, with a streak of lemony acidity, but concentrated with a long, honey-tinged finish.",89,42.0,Rheingau
57966,US,"The producer continues to hit it out of the park with this vintage of Pinot, offering a gorgeously balanced interpretation of a marquee vineyard site. Rose petal and lavender aromas evolve into flavors of rosemary, high-toned orange peel, dried cherry and cranberry on the palate, keeping things ethereal throughout. Smooth and medium bodied, the tannins are coy and the entire experience memorable.",94,70.0,California

57978,France,"Appetizing notes of ripe Cox Orange Pippin apples, both in their fresh, crunchy state and in a more mellow baked version, characterize the flavors of this wine, with overtones of strawberry and sun-warmed stone.

Drink now until 2030 at least.",94,80.0,Alsace
57979,Germany,"The numbers on this wine are amazing (380 g/l residual sugar, 17 g/l TA), but even more impressive is how such an extremely sweet wine can remain reasonably drinkable, complex and harmonious. It's musky and spice-laden, filled with dried apricot and honey flavors that linger on the incredibly long, citrusy finish. Should age indefinitely.",95,333.0,Pfalz
57980,France,"This marks an impressive step forward for this wine that's so often been in the shadows of other wines in the Lafite-Rothschild stable.

As good as it is, it will benefit from 8-12 years in a proper cellar.",96,195.0,California
57983,US,"A Pinot Noir Port is a rare creature, and somewhat contradictory. How to match the delicacy of the Pinot Noir grape with the power and punch of Port-style, fortified wines?

58007,Italy,"Alluring aromas of exotic spice, purple flower, dark-skinned berry and a balsamic note lead the nose.

It nicely balances weight and finesse.",93,92.0,Veneto
58008,France,"From grapes grown at this estate and vinified by the Tutiac cooperative in Blaye on the north bank of the Gironde Estuary, this wine is easy, soft and fruity.

58009,US,"You won't miss the taste of oak one bit, because this Chard is so rich and crisply stimulating on its own. It floods the palate with pineapple jam, peach pie, green apple butter, vanilla and cinnamon-honey granola flavors that are clean and pure.",87,25.0,California
58010,US,"Lots of raisins, prunes and heavy baking spice show on the nose of this single-vineyard bottling, as well as hints of black pepper and shredded asphalt. Exotic figs and prunes also make an appearance on the palate, which is framed by a decent tannic grip.",87,46.0,California
58011,France,"Rich, wood-aged wine, smooth and ripely fruity. Aromas of mint lead to the polished, ripe, elegant fruit, the tannins surrounded by a comfortable fruit texture. It will age over 4–5 years.",91,19.0,Bordeaux
58012,Italy,"A blend of 80% Nerello Mascalese and 20% Petit Verdot, this offers aromas of toast, mature black-skinned berry, scorched earth, espresso and clove. The evolved palate delivers dried black currant, licorice, roasted coffee bean and tobacco alongside close grained tannins.",89,24.0,Sicily & Sardinia
58013,US,"This is quite pretty, with a soft initial entry into strawberry fruit. There's a touch of resin, a whisper of chocolate, and overall a delicate sensibility, that gains strength and length with ample aeration. It exits smoothly with a finishing lick of caramel.",91,42.0,Oregon

58015,US,"This flagship blend is sourced from 25-year-old vines. It's sharply focused and bright, the strawberry and cherry flavors front and center. The flavors have a hard candy quality, with pleasant hints of toast and caramel through the close.",90,39.0,Oregon
58016,Australia,"Comes out of the chute showing a funky, rubbery edge, but that blows off with a little time to reveal dark, somewhat earthy notes of cola and blackberry. It's medium-bodied, with good length to the finish, where it picks up enough dusty tannins to give it backbone.",87,9.0,Western Australia
58017,France,"A very rich wine, showing all the opulence of 2009. Black plums, damsons and wood flavors are already combined and integrated. The acidity in all this richness and power seems low, leaving the tannins to support aging.",95,304.0,Burgundy
58018,Chile,"The nose on this blend of Syrah, Cabernet Sauvignon and Carmenère is herbal and a touch mulchy, with berry, coffee and olive aromas. The palate feels thick and on the cusp of syrupy, with baked, creamy black-fruit flavors that bring carob, chocolate and herbs accents to a modest finish. This is ripe in feel but still smells and tastes a bit herbal.",88,22.0,Cachapoal Valley
58019,US,"This is very appealing when first popped, with plenty of forward  butter and caramel scents livening up the fresh fruit. Ready to drink right now, it retains enough acid to stand up to food, though the finish is a little bitter from all the new oak.",87,22.0,Washington
58020,Austria,"There is something smoky and grilled about the nose. While the red fruit of strawberry and cherry is fresh, there are also aromas of roasted oak. Nonetheless, the fruit itself is delicate and tart, translucent and unforced. The palate is slender and fresh, with a deep core of red berries. This may take time to come into its own. Drink 2018–2024.",90,,Niederösterreich
58021,US,"This blend of 90% Sauvignon Blanc with some Sauvignon Gris and Musque grapes does its best to achieve ripeness, but it's dominated by green flavors of gooseberries, along with a hint of ammonia. Dry and a bit vegetal in style, this barrel-aged wine finishes on a tart note.",84,33.0,California
58022,US,"Ripe strawberry compote typifies this appealing wine. The nicely ripened fruit is set in a mineral-driven, high acid frame, and shows both texture and length as it develops in the mouth. It's especially noteworthy given the moderate alcohol.",90,45.0,Oregon

58025,US,"Fruit compote—plum and strawberry—is melded to light toast and coffee. The wine has juicy acids and a thickly satisfying midpalate whose fruit flavors linger on, adding a little peppery spice as the wine evolves in the mouth. Just a whisp of chocolate leaves you ready for the next sip.",90,36.0,Washington

58029,US,"Lots of sweet fruit is right up front here—super ripe berry/cherry flavors—that quickly fade and leave a rather dull finish. It's two thirds Cabernet Franc, the rest a blend of Cabernet Sauvignon, Syrah and just a splash of Petit Verdot.",84,30.0,Washington
58030,France,"This wine is already attractively balanced with ripe red plum fruits giving weight. That is backed by the firm wood and fruit tannins that offer spice and a creamy texture. Drink from 2017. An Alain Aubert estate, it is run by daughter and oenologist Amélie Aubert.",88,15.0,Bordeaux
58031,US,"This is a good value for a sophisticated Merlot from Napa Valley. It's not an ager, but it's delightful now for its dryness, smooth tannins and complex cherry and red currant flavors with hints of herbs and sweet peas.",88,19.0,California
58032,Germany,"Lip tingling lime acidity sends a jolt through this lusciously fruity wine. Off dry in style, it juxtaposes sweet-tart lemon and honey tangerine flavors against steely, piercing minerality.",93,28.0,Mosel
58033,US,"This full-bodied and assertive wine from hillside vineyards has earthy aromas, ripe but dry fruit flavors, and a dense texture due to mouth-coating tannins. It will need time in the bottle to round off, but should be delicious after 2018.",89,29.0,California
58034,France,This crisp red-currant-flavored wine is packed with acidity. It is tense and juicy with a light brushstroke of vanilla. But it is the intense acidity that sets the tone for this wine. Make this a food—not an apéritif—wine.,85,25.0,Loire Valley
58035,US,"Tight and dry in tannins now, with an astringent mouthfeel that feels like sandpaper. So is it an ager? It's dry and balanced and rich in blackberries, cherries and currants, so it might be. Try after 2012, if you're the gambling type.",86,48.0,California

58037,US,"Made from 100% Pinot Noir grapes left for more than two years en tirage, this is a dark reddish-pink wine with an intensity of strawberry and raspberry that falls a tad flat midway through and into the finish. With a tiny amount of sugar, it veers slightly sweet.",85,35.0,California
58038,US,"This winery produces a slew of Pinot Noirs each year, and this specific clonal study shows clove and cardamom on the somewhat subdued nose. The flavors are more forward, dominated by black tea and cherry, with a touch of tannin.",89,55.0,California

58040,US,"Dry, minerally and acidic, this Chardonnay offers pineapple, lemon and mineral flavors. It's a food-friendly wine that won't compete with what you eat. At this price, it's a good restaurant wine, and easy to find, with 7,500 cases produced.",86,19.0,California
58041,US,"This wine leaps out of the glass with fresh and bright aromas of strawberry blossoms, ripe raspberries, red flowers and a tiny bit of iron.

58042,US,"Waxy lanolin, lime zest and savory nuts waft solemnly from this distinctly earthy dry Riesling. It's a showcase of minerality—shades of clay, dust, smoke and rock—but fascinatingly so, bolstered by a shock of lemon-lime acidity.",87,40.0,New York
58043,US,"Pommard and 777 clone grapes were cofermented and aged in a single new Allier oak barrel. Ripe, round and bursting with flavor, this luscious wine is a paean to blackberry fruit. Veins of licorice, espresso and dark chocolate weave through the extended finish. Cellar this for another few years if you can keep your hands off it, but know that it is almost too good to wait for.",94,75.0,Oregon
58044,US,"This four-grape, Bordeaux-style blend offers firm, concentrated plum and cassis fruit, stiff tannins and a touch of iron and graphite. It saw 45% new French oak—pretty impressive for a $25 red.",91,25.0,Washington

58050,US,"Minty, this restrained Syrah is from a sought-after vineyard, a pioneer in Sonoma County Rhône-style wines. Here, the producer keeps things interesting in swathes of white pepper, mint and cranberry, as well as a strong sense of leather throughout. High in acidity, it needs time to come together; try after 2020.",91,38.0,California
58051,US,"One of the producer's longest-standing vineyard sources, this Hyde is gorgeously savory and lightly textured, while offering plenty of depth and complexity on the palate. Aromatically, it presents inviting orange zest, cherry and cranberry, elements that follow in taste, finished off by a flash of white pepper. Fresh and fruity, this wine also provides smooth, yet sizable tannins.",93,70.0,California
58052,New Zealand,"Seems a bit disjointed, showing some attractive ripe stone fruit character and tropical notes that then veer into an odd, banana-like part of the fruit spectrum. Warm and spicy on the finish rather than crisp and refreshing.",83,,Marlborough
58053,US,"This popular bottling offers the tropical fruit salad array it always has, with honeydew, cantaloupe, pineapple, guava and banana aromas. Yet, this particular vintage has a refreshing zestiness. Steely structure and lime-like acidity drive the palate, balancing its buttercream and peach custard flavors.",88,18.0,California
58054,France,The wine is from a tiny parcel (around an acre) of vines that are over 30-years-old. It is concentrated both with fine fruit and sweet acidity. Yellow fruits are cut with lime and green plums. A touch of vanilla gives the wine a full final aftertaste. Drink from 2017.,90,20.0,Burgundy
58055,France,"While this shows the concentration of the vines that were planted in the 1940s, it also has a tight, lean quality and considerable acidity. Its fruit is still subdued by the structure, and it needs 3–4 years to become round.",87,,Burgundy
58056,US,"An estate-grown wine in its second vintage, this comes from the cooler-climate hills of the coast. This plush wine is dark brown in color and brimming in stinky earth—a rich, funky and concentrated expression that's herbal, spicy and shy in raspberry fruit.",90,85.0,California
58057,France,"Named after the Laroche winery, L'Obédiencerie, this wine is a selection from the Blanchots Grand Cru vineyard. It is rich, but endowed with a taut minerality that cuts through the ripe green plum and crisp pear flavors. It demands aging. Drink from 2020.",95,170.0,Burgundy
58058,New Zealand,"The Te Muna Road section of Martinborough is the same region exploited by Craggy Range and Escarpment, so Cobblestone's American owners are in good company. Only the second release of this wine, the 2010 is a plush, sexy example, featuring a combination of fruity and savory components.

58061,US,"This is one of those fresh, young Cabs that reminds you of Beaujolais. It's fruity and silky and jammy, with a pink bubblegum gassiness. Give it a chill, cut it with some sparkling water, put in a slice of strawberry and enjoy.",84,12.0,California

58063,France,"This creamy wine has a really ripe character. Acidity comes from the cooler location of the vineyard, while the warmth of the summer shows through in the yellow fruits as well as in the fresh, crunchy red apples. A textured edge conveys minerality and leaves a fresh, clean taste in the mouth. Drink from 2017.",92,52.0,Burgundy
58064,US,"Reddish-pink and orange in color, this wine made from Cabernet Franc grapes works on every level, offering a taste of pomegranate and fresh-squeeed orange that keeps it dry and refreshing as it goes down. Given no time in new oak, it exhibits watermelon and cherry on the finish.",91,28.0,California

58066,France,"Part of the select group of impressive wines from this year, this wine is ripe, rich and firmly structured. Black-currant fruitiness forms the base for solid tannins and a concentrated texture. The hints of wood-aging need to soften. Drink from 2022.",93,,Bordeaux

58071,US,"Aromas of glue, bacon fat and earth make for a confounding bouquet that really doesn't welcome you in. The plump, creamy palate has some bright citrus, but mostly it's about underripe melon. The tart, short finish is clean, but not terribly convincing.",86,16.0,California
58072,Austria,"The Steinriegl vineyard fruit results in a tight, structured Riesling. The fruit is taut and very crisp, with acidity and flavors of green apples and citrus.

58073,US,"It's always a treat to discover a good, well-made but not overpowering wine. This one has nothing in excess, just moderate and crisp fruit flavors with light spicy accents.

58082,Argentina,"Heady plum and dark berry aromas give a warning of size and ripeness, and indeed there's a ton of ripe fruit to the palate; but the wine is also raw, untamed and lacking in mouthfeel. It could stand to flow and finish better than it does.",84,11.0,Mendoza Province
58083,France,"This dry rosé is perfumed with red-currant fruits. On the palate, the theme of crisp red fruits continues, with acidity, a touch of pepper and smokiness from the Cabernet Franc in the blend. Drink the wine, with its tight acidity at the end, now.",85,13.0,Loire Valley

58085,Portugal,"Even Cabernet Sauvignon, that defiantly international variety, takes on a Portuguese character. This has that dark chocolate, high acidity and dry, but juicy character that marks so many Portuguese reds. It also has a more unfortunate volatility that is just too prominent.",85,15.0,Estremadura

This is a very tight and focused Chardonnay.",87,28.0,California

58293,US,"As rich as this Cabernet Sauvignon-based blend is, and it is extraordinarily rich, there's something standard about it. It's as though the ripeness of the fruit has obliterated any trace of terroir.

It's a harmonious blend of Zinfandel, Merlot, Cabernet Sauvignon and Syrah.",88,12.0,California
58327,Spain,"Rubbery berry and plum aromas come with a note of latex. In the mouth, this is juicy, bright and focused, with good raspberry and plum fruit. Textural balance is an attribute, while the finish is round, lively and full of tasty berry flavors. Drink through 2018.",89,30.0,Catalonia
58328,US,"Still dependable despite changes in ownership, this winery again delivers an elegant, well-made wine. With this vintage, it veers more toward herbaceous notes than fruity ones. The dominant flavors are of green olives and sweet bell pepper. Don't think, however, that it's lean. Oak provides fatness, and the right foods, like grilled red meat, will coax out the berry sweetness.",87,22.0,California
58329,France,"The top Pouilly Fumé from Joseph Mellot is a complex wine with rich, rounded fruits touched by wood aging. Yellow fruits dominate, given a further lift by apple acidity and a smoky flavor. Delicious now, it's a powerful wine that could age further, so keep until 2015.",93,49.0,Loire Valley
58330,US,"The sixteenth edition of Dunham's benchmark Cabernet Sauvignon bears a strong scent of new oak—it's aged in 70% French and 30% American. The wood is dominant, which is not surprising in a wine built for long term aging. Given plenty of time to breathe, bright red fruits, citrusy acids and a lovely mix of toast, caramel and clove accents emerge.",93,45.0,Washington
58331,France,"Flinty overtones of yeast reveal how very young this wine is. The verve that springs from the glass is undeniable. While the focus is on grapefruit and lemon zest in a tightly pulled focus, there are glimpses of honeycomb, popcorn, treacle, pollen and hints of tropicality, with a touch of pineapple. Hold this wine for a while longer and it will unfold itself graciously. Drink 2016–2020.",92,30.0,Alsace
58332,US,"Aromas of melted butter, vanilla, stone fruit and baking spices lead to full-bodied peach flavors. The palate brings a creamy feel and lemony flavors on the finish.",89,48.0,Washington
58333,US,"Sanguine in cassis, cranberry and wild strawberry, this relatively inexpensive Napa Cab has an herbal edge that suggests elegance and balance. The finish is stamped in oak that lingers on the palate without overwhelming.",87,25.0,California
58334,Italy,"A fifty-fifty blend of Aglianico and Piedirosso, this monolithic wine is dominated by sweet oak, coffee and espresso sensations along with undertones of black fruit. Additional fruity richness would better support the overwhelming oak and astringent wood tannins.",86,25.0,Southern Italy
58335,US,"Though definitely grassy in the nose, this round and juicy wine has compelling freshness. Flavors of grapefruit, lime, fresh herbs and a dash of wintergreen give complexity and length.",90,21.0,Oregon
58336,Italy,"A blend of Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot and Syrah, this shows savory spice, smoked meat and tobacco notes, followed by black-berry, dark cherry and cola. The palate is fresh and clean, but it has enough heft to be paired with grilled meat.",91,30.0,Tuscany
58337,Italy,"This wine offers a delicate fragrance of pressed white flower, apricot and peach. The palate delivers citrus and toasted almond notes, creamy texture and small, persistent bubbles.",88,50.0,Lombardy
58338,US,"From a ripe and picture-perfect growing season, this wine has luscious and concentrated waves of fig, melon and vanilla, rounded out by an inviting, floral edge of orange blossom. Oaky toast and nutmeg highlight the midpalate, before the wine finishes in a sea of minerality.",90,38.0,California
58339,South Africa,"Peppery notes emanate from the bouquet first, followed by more traditional notes of black plum, black currant leaf and dried fig. The mouth is loaded with more brambly fruit flavors against an easygoing structure and light tannins.",86,19.0,Stellenbosch
58340,US,"This is a wine that wants a little time in the cellar. It has very rich, ripe, concentrated blackberry and cherry flavors, accented with bacon, smoky oak and black pepper. But it's tannic and the fruit is jammy. The parts simply haven't knit together. Give it 2–3 years.",89,35.0,California
58341,New Zealand,"This medium-bodied Pinot Noir is oaky. It starts off with smoky, meaty, hickory notes and never really incorporates them smoothly into the modest cherry fruit, and it adds a mocha note on the slightly tough finish. A grilled steak might help bring out the wine's fruity side.",84,29.0,Nelson
58342,US,"A blend of top sites Celilo and Conner Lee, this appealing wine displays aromas of candy corn, corn silk and chamomile. The stone-fruit flavors are elegantly styled, showing a sense of restraint and balance that carries through the lingering finish.",91,36.0,Washington
58343,Italy,"Aromas of graphite, black currant, plum, cedar, blue flowers and tobacco emerge from this full-bodied red. Made with Cabernet Franc and a drop of Petit Verdot, the structured palate offers blackberries, licorice, clove and a toasted note alongside velvety tannins. It shows great finesse, especially for the torrid 2011 vintage. Drink 2016–2026.",95,419.0,Tuscany
58344,Argentina,"This is tight and sturdy as a rock up front, with licorice, hard spice, leather and black cherry aromas.

Drink now through 2016.",91,40.0,Mendoza Province
58345,Austria,"Subdued notes of clove and pepper mixed with tart cranberry make this an appetizing, fresh-faced red. The body is light but packs lots of flavor. What you see is what you get—in the most charming way possible.",89,,Burgenland
58346,Italy,"Plush and rich, but not too meaty or thick, Mediterra (as its Mediterranean-sounding name suggests) delivers aromas of small fruit, wild sage, leather and moist earth. The bouquet paints a pretty picture of the territory in coastal Tuscany that inspired this blended red wine.",91,25.0,Tuscany
58347,US,"Dry and soft, with the taste of cherry, roasted almond, crunchy granola and fig health candy bar. Enjoyable, but simple. Drink now.",84,20.0,California
58348,US,"Interesting aromatics of cumin, tree bark, chocolate and more on top of black fruit: cassis and plum, mostly. Oak and currants bring it home, with a fair share of toasted oak speaking up on the finish. Rich, plush and drinkable almost immediately.",89,40.0,California
58349,France,"Tender notes of citrus appear at first through a veil of yeast. Their zestiness then fills out with subtle, earthy spice. On the light, dry palate, the true subtlety hits: wafts of lemon, aromatic wild thyme, Seville orange zest, fresh apple peel and wet stone. The delicacy of the concentrated body is astonishing, with a central vein of lemony freshness that provides a focal point. So subtle, so layered and alive: with every new sip new nuances occur.",94,80.0,Alsace
58350,France,"This taut, tight wine is impressive. The mineral texture and crisp white fruits combine into a harmonious wine that is full of apple and pear flavors. It comes from the Grand Cru village of Avize, reflecting the chalk soil in its structure. Drink from 2019.",91,50.0,Champagne
58351,New Zealand,"Slightly more concentrated than other Marlborough Pinots in this price range, the 2008 Mana displays modest cherry fruit and an array of savory elements, including game, brine and peppery spice. It's a bit rough around the edges, yet in a charming sort of way. Drink now–2012.",87,17.0,Marlborough
58352,France,"This is a perfumed and generous wine with great tannins and a strong minerality. This is the first year that wines from the former Château Magdelaine were also included in Bélair as the two estates were amalgamated. It's dense, complex, balanced in character yet still with fruitiness of the vintage. Drink from 2024.",94,225.0,Bordeaux
58353,Argentina,"Bright fruit, mildly creamy, with good zest and acidity. Shows a sweet, savory center with hints of brown sugar and spice sitting along the edges. Easy tannins make it a friendly style; good for near-term drinking. No cellaring necessary.",87,15.0,Mendoza Province
58354,US,"The Mark series from Anam Cara represents a sort of mini-reserve, all estate-grown, with a selection of what the winemaker considers to be the “boldest” clones. It has full-bodied flavors of cherry and sassafras, accented with cinnamon and cocoa. The barrel spices outlast the fruit—perhaps just an indication of youth. There is potential for considerable improvement with bottle age.",88,65.0,Oregon
58355,Italy,"Lenaia Rosso (50% Merlot with Sangiovese and Colorino, vinified in cement) opens with foxy notes of crushed grape, root beer and bitter almond. It's short, crisp and fine on the finish.",87,,Tuscany
58356,France,"While this wine does not age in wood, it does age on its lees, giving it a rich, creamy texture. It's smooth, full and soft, its apricot and peach flavors showing ripeness and openness. Drink from 2018.",90,28.0,Burgundy
58357,France,"Firm and closed, this shows both richness and minerality. It has hidden power, concentration and a steely edge. It's crisp and densely packed with minerality and ripeness. For aging over at least seven years.",94,70.0,Burgundy
58358,US,"Big, dark and rich, the black-cherry fruit is veined with iron ore. That resonant minerality, along with zippy acids, makes this wine seem especially dry. Tannins are polished and flavors linger magnificently, with a mocha-java finish.",93,65.0,Oregon
58359,Italy,"You'll love the elegant packaging, seals and silk ribbons that adorn this festive red blend from Piedmont. Aromas of ripe fruit, spice, leather and dark chocolate are followed by tight, sweet tannins and a lean mouthfeel.",88,27.0,Piedmont
58360,Portugal,There is enough crispness to make this ripe wine tight and fruity. Its dry strawberry fruitiness comes with a light touch of pepper. Drink now.,84,11.0,Península de Setúbal
58361,US,"Although the tannins give this wine a hard astringency, they can't mask the richness of the fruit. Once you get used to the tannins, you find a blast of cherry and blackberry jam fruit. This is a wine to put in the cellar until 2018.",92,52.0,California
58362,Mexico,"Fiery, punchy aromas of red berries and herbaceous plants make for a rough start. Flavors of leafy red raspberry and plum are typical for basic Merlot, while the finish is juicy in feel, with herbal, leafy, lightly cooked flavors.",82,30.0,Valle de Guadalupe
58363,US,"Marc Piro continued to hone his craft under Jim Clendenen at Au Bon Climat, and that expertise shows in this bottling, which combines Presqu'ile and Bien Nacido Vineyards to produce a wine that's both zesty in the underripe style yet full of fruit as well. Aromas of wild oregano, thyme, tapenade and red cherry lead into a palate full of tantalizing acidity, with tart Montmorency cherry, tangy tomato and fennel spice.",93,32.0,California
58364,Chile,"Light strawberry aromas are a bit green and herbal. The mouthfeel is fresh but dilute, while flavors of oak and creamy tasting red-berry fruits finish firm but without a lot of depth. This is good for quaffing but doesn't go beyond that.",86,20.0,Casablanca Valley
58365,US,"The nose is a pleasant harmony of dark, ripe fruit, espresso grinds and carefully charred French oak. Coffee and cigar box notes carry through the palate as well, marrying with fresher red-fruit flavors. There's quite a bit of tannin to grapple with still, but overall, it's a pleasant medium-bodied red.",86,17.0,New Mexico
58366,US,"Generous in lemon custard and pear aromas and flavors, this is a fairly full-bodied style of Chardonnay. It offers roundness balanced by a minerally finish.",87,12.0,California
58367,Chile,"Pithy citrus and nectarine aromas announce a palate that's citrusy all the way. Flavors of orange, lemon and grapefruit keep a persistent citric character through the finish, which is basic but refreshing.",84,9.0,Central Valley
58368,US,"Light on the nose, this shows delicate aromas of Asian pear, honeysuckle, squeezed lemon wedge, fresh coconut flesh and a tiny bit of butter. The palate is also demure yet delicious, with lightly poached apples, squeezed lime and a chalky textural grip.",93,30.0,California
58369,US,"A beautiful Syrah. It's very dry and softly tannic, with complex blackberry, black cherry, cola and sandalwood flavors. Could be firmer in structure, but a lovely wine to drink now.",88,35.0,California
58370,US,Whiffs of dusty tobacco box and cedar accent roasted black-cherry and plum flavors in this light-bodied red blend. It's not a deeply concentrated wine but subtle earth and leaf complexities are elegant. The finish is marked by fine velvety tannins.,87,25.0,New York
58371,US,"A Meritage-style Bordeaux blend, it's very soft and lacking structural cohesion. The flavors of extracted blackberries, cherries, raspberries, blueberries and chocolate are almost good enough to compensate for the melted mouthfeel.",85,56.0,California
58372,France,"This wine is crisp and fruity. It has attractive acidity, a nice touch of spice and a backbone of minerality. The juiciness leaves a bright, crisp aftertaste.",86,35.0,Burgundy
58373,US,"Though 2014 is a fine, accessible vintage for many Oregon Pinots, this one is rather stubbornly shut down. At first it shows stem and herb flavors, along with chewy tannins. With hours of breathing time, the fruit emerges, a mix of rhubarb, cherry and a dash of cola.",89,50.0,Oregon
58374,US,"Browned butter, roasted almonds and walnuts, kumquat cream and iodine show on the nose of this oxidative style from Bill Foley's large portfolio. The palate is rich with toasty brioche and peanut-butter notes.",87,45.0,California
58375,US,"Cherry flavors turn a bit syrupy, with a sour cherry candy appeal. Acidic and slightly volatile, this tight, chewy wine spent 14 months in 40% new French oak barrels.",87,34.0,Oregon
58376,Spain,"A typically reserved Navarran wine is what this is. The nose offers dry red fruit, spice and not much else. The palate is mildly citric and herbal, but there's enough cherry and leather to carry things to a medium-length   finish of dill, vanilla and spice. A nice and simple food wine.",85,13.0,Northern Spain
58377,France,"With low yields after a hail storm, the wine is concentrated and dense. It has a touch of wood aging as well as dark black fruits. The tannins are firm in a wine that will age well over the medium term. Drink from 2023.",90,25.0,Bordeaux
58378,Israel,"The nose offers earthy, medicinal notes on the light black-cherry fruit. Thin on the palate, it has a cough syrup-like taste. The tannins are soft, the acids low. Finishes short.",80,19.0,Galil
58379,US,"Earns extra credit for the sheer audacity of ripe cherry, raspberry and vanilla cream flavors. Almost as sweet as a candy bar, but actually dry, and balanced with acidity and minerals. A fine Pinot Noir that should develop bottle complexity over the next six years.",90,45.0,California
58380,France,"This bold, ripe wine is full of smoky tannins from the wood aging, plus blackberry jam flavors that are nicely cut by the acidity. The dry core and dark chocolate flavors are balanced by the fresher, richer fruit. Drink now.",88,15.0,Bordeaux

58383,US,"Produced from a single clone—Dijon 777—this late release has a hint of leather around candied cherry fruit, mixed with sweetened cranberry. It's concentrated and rounded off, with brown spice highlights. Drink now to 2020.",91,50.0,Oregon
58384,US,"This is a limited-production wine made principally from 45-year-old vines. Dry, textural and complex, it mixes Key lime, tangerine, orange peel and citrus oil with a burnishing hint of Cointreau.",92,20.0,Oregon
58385,Chile,"Dark gold color and buttery nose say that it was heavily oaked during its fermentation and afterward. The palate is flat and resiny. On the finish, buttered toast and some bitter, oaky leftovers hold it back.",84,35.0,Casablanca Valley
58386,US,"From a replanted block of the vineyard, this wine is zesty, savory and high in acidity. With a backbone of stony texture and a deep core of licorice and strawberry flavors, it's bold in tannins and intensity, yet finishes bright.",90,85.0,California
58387,US,"Coming from a blend of top sites Red Willow and Forgotten Hills, this wine offers reserved aromas of berry, herb, smoked meat and pepper. The palate brings bright acid and intensity of flavor but with a sense of elegance that keeps you hanging on each sip.",92,55.0,Washington

58389,US,"This 100% varietal, barrel-fermented wine from the hallowed site delivers a grip of tension and balanced weight, providing power within its layers of texture.

58391,France,"This 50/50 Duras and Syrah blend from father and son Jean Paul and Nicolas Hirissou is a ripe, fruity wine that is attractively mature. It is finely integrated with berry fruits that are lifted by the acidity and given a fine shape by the gentle tannins. The wine is ready to drink.",88,12.0,Southwest France
58392,US,"Racy and bright, with high acidity framing dry flavors of lemons, limes and grapefruits. There's a green streak of gooseberry that signals some unripeness.",85,17.0,California
58393,Chile,"Green, soupy aromas of tomato are blatant and harsh. This is decent in terms of mouthfeel, but it reverts to herbaceous, leafy flavors of bell pepper and grass that finish with nothing but pyrazines.",81,11.0,Maipo Valley
58394,US,"A robust wine with strong, complex flavors of cherries, red currants, mocha, grilled meat, bacon and plenty of peppery spices. A bit forward and unsubtle, but deliciously dry, with smooth, dusty tannins and a cut of acidity. Seems at its best now with rich fare like lamb. Mourvèdre, Carignane and Graciano.",90,32.0,California
58395,US,"Creamy aromas of vanilla yogurt, custard, apple pie and cinnamon show on the nose of this wine from a longtime family of grape growers. The palate is crisp with pear juice, rounded with marzipan flavors and touched with light honeysuckle flowers.",91,28.0,California

58397,France,"This benchmark rosé is round yet fresh, and crisp while ripely fruity. Red berry fruits are finely textured and attractive acidity cuts through the full body of the wine. It would be worth aging until late 2014.",91,21.0,Provence
58398,US,"A lovely Cabernet, rich and ripe in blackberries and cassis, with a touch of herbs and a little heat from high alcohol. A good steak, with its salty fattiness, will take care of that. But it's tannic. Not so much that you can't drink it now, but it really wants a year or two in the cellar.",91,75.0,California
58399,Germany,"Notes of lemon and cherry blossom brighten tones of crushed stone and slate on this semi-dry Riesling. Juicy and ripe with flavors of melon and white peach, it's intensely fruity and floral but honed with reverberating minerality on the finish.",90,32.0,Mosel

58403,US,"This intriguing mix of cedar and cassis, with meatier elements of black licorice, sings in the glass, remaining restrained and elegant despite a full-bodied ripeness and cradling of French oak.

58404,France,"This is a rich wine with a warm character. It comes from vines in the heart of Chablis, facing the Grand Cru vineyards on the opposite side of the river. It's full bodied and ripe, with plenty of acidity to partner its yellow fruit. Drink from 2019.",93,35.0,Burgundy
58405,Germany,"Enticing notes of brioche and baker's yeast waft from this brut-style Riesling Sekt. It's perfumed and floral, yet elegantly composed, drenching the palate in waves of fresh grapefruit and lime. Piercing and pristine, it finishes with crystalline precision.",90,36.0,Mosel
58406,France,"The wine comes from a parcel that is less than an acre. Vines aged for 45 years on average have created a structured, concentrated wine with powerful tannins and dark, black fruits. It is a wine for serious aging, It's unlikely to be ready before 2020.",93,142.0,Burgundy

The alluring juiciness of the palate hints at small, yellow mirabelle plums but as of yet merely plays at the surface.

58416,US,"Where else in this country can you find $12 Pinot with actual varietal character? Yes, it's quite young, light, lean, tart and even simple, but it does taste like the grape it's made from, and avoids the vegetal and the overtly leathery qualities of many of its rivals. Gentle flavors of raspberry and cherry are supported with juicy acids and hints of spice. This would be a lovely companion to a simple roast chicken.",87,12.0,Oregon

58434,France,"Made with organic grapes, this rosé is a blend of 30% Grenache Gris, 30% Grenache Noir, 30% Merlot and 10% Cabernet Franc. It's a dainty and floral selection, with forward scents of sweet pea, lavender, laurel and white tea. The palate offers some tart white cherry and currant fruitiness, with medium acidity and a subtle sweet-spice accent on the close.",86,16.0,Languedoc-Roussillon
58435,US,"Gentle tannins and a streak of black pepper stand out in this well-crafted, powerful wine. It offers up pillowy texture and just enough grip to remain seamless and compelling on the palate. Moderate acidity adds structure and brightness to the concentrated black fruit.",92,100.0,California
58436,US,"While most of this wine was fermented in French oak, a small percentage was held back in stainless steel. It finds a happy middle ground between creamy oak, even a touch of reduction, and a brightness of green apple and Jolly Rancher. It offers medium-bodied richness.",88,32.0,California
58437,France,"The fuller rosé of the two made at Les Valentines, this is rich, balanced and dense in character. That makes it a serious wine, its acidity finely integrated into the red plum and orange zest flavors. It's a perfect food rosé.",91,25.0,Provence
58438,US,"While the nose is ripe and plush with sweet smelling red-cherry and strawberry aromas, this is a surprisingly brisk, light-footed Pinot Noir. The palate is lean with crisp, briary red fruit and drying, slightly astringent tannins on the finish.",86,16.0,New York
58439,South Africa,"This is a grassy, lean bottling with a bit too much asparagus and vegetal notes on both the nose and palate. The flavor profile features some grapefruit and green apple, but the fruit is rather dilute and distant. Beyond that, the finish is dry, almost like drinking club soda.",85,16.0,Franschhoek
58440,US,"Nicely dry and tart in acidity, this pretty wine is fine to drink now. Flavors recall citrus fruits with richer notes of papayas, along with gooseberries and green mint from cool-climate grapes. Made without the malolactic fermentation, the wine was coopered in 55% French oak.",88,33.0,California
58441,Spain,"Narrow, pointed aromas of licorice and snappy, herbal fruits filter into a hard, tannic palate.

For a 2005, this is showing its cards; drink now.",85,50.0,Catalonia

58443,US,"Defines Carneros in its rich, nuanced aromas of fig, ripe peach, tangerine, nutmeg and oaky vanilla. Winemaker-induced complexities from barrel fermentation and lees aging. Tremendous depth of flavor, it just sings on the palate and is so rich and spicy. The ultralong finish is sweet and satisfying.",93,18.0,California
58444,South Africa,"This Bordeaux-style blend, made from 45% Cabernet Sauvignon, 24% Malbec, 16% Merlot and 15% Cabernet Franc, is a complex and layered wine. Pleasant green notes of savory herbs, peppercorn, blackcurrant leaf and brambly berry drive the bouquet, while the medium-weight palate offers flavors of black-fruit skin, char and cigar box all framed by a crushed-velvet texture. It shows good grip, concentration and length, and should drink well through 2021.",91,25.0,Stellenbosch
58445,US,"This vibrantly light, restrained wine comes from some hallowed vineyards, including Hudson, Stagecoach and Crocker & Starr, the blend comprised of 38% Cabernet Franc, 34% Cabernet Sauvignon and 28% Merlot. Dark in color, it offers aromas of cherry liqueur and orange, and remains dry on the palate, low in power and high in minerality.",88,25.0,California
58446,US,"Meticulously farmed by Ulises Valdez, Silver Eagle is intensely spicy and pamperingly lush, offering a distinct, perfumed character on the nose. Structured and almost gamy and sanguine, it's a complex expression of the grape that will benefit from further time in the bottle, through 2020, or from an hour or so in the decanter.",94,59.0,California
58447,US,"Some Pinot Noirs are soft and lush. Others are lean and tart. This Pinot is a little of both. A blend of the winery's three single-vineyard 2011s, it shows the qualities of them all. The result is dry, tart, elegant and ready to drink now. You'll find acid-driven sour-cherry candy, persimmon and tobacco spice flavors, with a touch of smoky oak.",91,45.0,California
58448,US,"Zesty aromas of bramble and alpine strawberry are laid across an underlying chalkiness and graphite minerality, making for an inviting yet well-structured nose on this Grenache-based pink wine. Ripe strawberry and hibiscus notes show first on the palate, which rides a tense, chalky line, presenting flavors that are persistent but not overpowering.",90,30.0,California
58449,Italy,"This Riserva red wine from Puglia represents an 80-20 blend of Negroamaro and Malvasia Nera and delivers a rich bouquet with a spicy oak element backed by loads of mature black fruit or candied cherry.

58452,US,"Quite possibly this has the largest production of any single Oregon Pinot Noir, which makes the quality even more impressive.

It's broadly fruity and forward on the palate, with zippy acidity that punches through the finish.",88,19.0,Oregon
58453,US,"Oaky toast and salty, firm acidity give this wine a flavor profile of lemon, apple and dried herb that's lengthy and full of complexity. Medium bodied, it finds balance between fruit flavors and a savory edge, remaining bright and rich on the palate.",91,52.0,California

58455,New Zealand,"Winemaker Helen Masters is trying to get a bit more texture into her Sauvignon Blanc by incorporating a small portion that's been fermented on the skins. It adds a bit of richness to the already ripe flavors of fig, nectarine, melon and pineapple. Drink now.",88,20.0,Martinborough

58458,US,"A blend of Sangiovese (66%), Cabernet Sauvignon (22%) and Merlot, this wine offers hints of dark raspberries, black currant, vanilla and herbs. It's broad and flavorful with somewhat astringent tannins that hopefully will mellow with some additional time in bottle.",87,29.0,Washington
58459,Germany,"Fluffy, almost cloud-like in mouthfeel, this finely textured late-release Riesling already shows clues of just a few years of bottle-age magic. Savory notes of white mushroom and spice lend umami to slicks of sweet marmalade, grapefruit and honey. It's an enticing wine at a surprisingly gentle price.",90,23.0,Mosel
58460,US,"Despite being nearly six years old, the tannins in this wine are still huge and hard. But the beautiful acidity and the incredibly intense fruity concentration suggests this has more time left to evolve in the bottle. It is the essence of black currant, crème de cassis and mineral, focused into a single sip. The wine should start softening around 2018, and continue to evolve well into the 2020s.",94,70.0,California
58461,France,"Lemon and green apple are the chief flavors of this easy Riesling that provides honest and uncomplicated refreshment. It finishes dry, with a fresh, lemony aftertaste.",87,19.0,Alsace
58462,US,"An impressive Syrah, not just for its ripeness, but for the structure. Fine, firm tannins and acids, along with well-integrated oak, provide a classic framework to the ripe blackberries, leather and chocolate. Good now, with decanting, but really wants 2–4 years of aging.",91,35.0,California
58463,US,"This wine is muted and still youthful, a blend of mostly Cabernet with 13% Merlot, 7% Syrah, 3% Petite Sirah and 1% Cabernet Franc. Pencil lead and dust fight for attention around big, bittersweet tannin and tobacco, not sure whether or not to let the black currant and cassis shine through.",89,50.0,California

58466,France,"This vineyard is widely regarded for its quality worthy of grand cru status, and this wine, from vines owned by Louis Jadot, is a fine example. It is both structured and richly fruity—dense with ripe red fruit flavors cut with acidity. A dry core of tannins will allow this impressive wine to age. Drink from 2024.",94,206.0,Burgundy
58467,US,"Although it's a little slender and simple, it's good for the price and offers pleasant cherry and spice flavors that finish dry.",85,9.0,California
58468,US,"Tight citrus aromas meet with bubblegum and wet stone on the somewhat reserved though clean and inviting nose of this wine. The flavors are also quite light, with strawberry and lemon touches, so the point is more of the racy acidity and slight tannic grip.",86,14.0,California
58469,US,"Bright cherry fruit is set against a backdrop of clean earth, while the young tannins are firm and focused. The wine carries balanced suggestions of leaf and herb, and will surely benefit from further bottle age.",90,55.0,Oregon
58470,US,"A little reticent and cool at first; patient airing allows it to open up and display raspberry, cola and herbal aromatics, followed by spicy black-cherry fruit. It's a very clean, pure, proper wine that will competently grace most dinner tables.",89,45.0,California
58471,US,"Good price for a Pinot of this quality. It's dry and silky in the mouth, with classic Pinot flavors of cherries, spices and cola, enriched with smoky oak.",87,21.0,California
58472,US,"Concentrated strawberry and plum blossom aromas are boosted with iron and a touch of oak smoke on the nose of this bottling by winemaker Steve Martell. The palate shows ripe red currant, woody elderberry brush and a shred of asphalt.",88,25.0,California
58473,US,"This is a dark, drily tannic young Syrah whose blackberry, currant and pepper flavors are compromised by less ripe, minty tastes. It's so close to being a really nice wine, until that greenness kicks in. Drink now.",84,38.0,California
58474,US,Rich flavors like vanilla and fig combine with a creamy texture and sweet finish to make a cream puff of a wine. The texture is soft and acidity quite low.,84,11.0,California

58476,US,"Monolith is a Bordeaux-style blend—mostly Cabernet Sauvignon—that's dark, smooth and smoky. Citrus scents adorn the deep fruit, which resolves in earthy, substantial tannins. The wine spent 22 months in 100% new French oak, yet the barrel notes seem muted, and the intense fruit is certainly up to the challenge.",92,34.0,Washington
58477,France,"The highly aromatic nose is vaguely suggestive of cotton candy, but the flavors are dry and precise, offering hints of white chocolate and white peach and ending on a citrusy note.",85,15.0,Rhône Valley
58478,US,"Good flavors of blackberries, currants and cedar in this wine, with a rich, chocolately edge. There are problems with the structure, though, that lead to a sharp, prickly mouthfeel. Drink now.",86,40.0,California
58479,Chile,"Bland, fleshy aromas of corn and apple cider are unconvincing but not overtly negative. This feels plump and heavy, like fruit punch. Flavors of cantaloupe and citrus fruits finish yeasty, with notes of corn and white bread.",84,12.0,Central Valley
58480,Australia,"Based on this example and a few other informal tastings, 2014 will be a top vintage for Rieslings from Western Australia. Aromas of lime sherbet and wet stone lead into a crisply focused palate loaded with citrusy tartness that lingers on the mouthwatering finish. Drink now with shellfish, and consider holding some for up to 10 years.",92,21.0,Western Australia
58481,US,"This is a good, dark, iron-rich wine, with earth and mineral dominating through a tart finish. Interesting change of pace.",86,15.0,Oregon

58483,Italy,"Vibrant and linear, this opens with aromas of leafy underbrush, moist soil, woodland berry and chopped herb.

Drink 2018–2030.",90,32.0,Piedmont
58484,Chile,"This is basic and mild as a whole. The nose blends citrus, apple and fresh bell pepper aromas in front of a zesty, medium-intensity palate with standard citrus flavors including lime and orange. For a refreshing quaff this summer, this more than suffices.",85,12.0,San Antonio
58485,US,"To call this wine huge is an understatement. Blended from Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, Malbec, Petit Verdot, Syrah and Carmenère, its most notable feature is tannins. It's hard, dry and astringent, making it difficult to appreciate now. But there's a gigantic core of blackberries and black currants. With richness like this, it should age and improve through 2020 at least.",91,70.0,California

58488,US,"More powerful and potent than the '04, this simply has more juice, more depth, more power and more detail than any previous Sheridan wine. The fruit is exceptional—dense black cherry and cassis, with a sense of compact layering that promises great aging potential. This was 30 months in oak but does not seem oaky in any way. It already has the balance, the polish and the length to justify long-term cellaring. Tannins are ripe and supple, bringing in hints of dried herb and black olive.",94,75.0,Washington
58489,France,"At this stage, the wine is all dark structure and very firm. It will need time to develop its full potential as an intensely rich wine. Concentrated and firm, it is powered by tannins as well as sweet red fruits. So age for five years at least.",94,85.0,Burgundy
58490,US,"Another beautifully crafted wine from Chehalem, this combines inviting citrus, melon and papaya fruit with just the right amount of buttered popcorn flavors from new oak. Silky and elegant, it is delicious now but will cellar well.",90,19.0,Oregon

58496,Australia,"Sourced largely from the northern end of the region, this features bold blackberry flavors slightly reminiscent of preserves and marked by dark shadings of cola and chocolate. Yet despite the superripe flavors, the wine remains well structured and retains some slightly herbal overtones. Drink now–2012.",89,18.0,South Australia
58497,Austria,"Restrained notes of yellow plum pervade the greenish, citric freshness. The palate is crisp and grassy, refreshing but textured, with added interest from fragrant lime peel. A concentrated palate leads to a superclean, lime-tingling finish.",90,24.0,Südoststeiermark
58498,France,"Deep gold color. Quite evolved aromas of citrus marmalade, truffles and a strong earthy minerality. full-bodied with broad, earthy flavors, ripe tropical fruit and hints of honey.

58502,US,"The nose on this bottling leans a bit sweet yet remains zesty, with ripe apples, pears, lime sorbet and lemon-lime soda. But the sip is racy and sizzling with buoyant acidity, delivering tightly wound Bosc pear and Gravenstein apple flavors doused with citrus spray.",91,26.0,California
58503,Chile,"A refreshing wine, with nicely ripened fruit and exceptional balance, that's pleasant in every way and a super value, too.  The fruit goes beyond citrus into more deeply flavored apricot and pear, and modest sur lie aging adds creamy, buttery notes.  This is a lovely wine and one of the best values of the year in Sauvignon/Fume Blanc.",87,10.0,Casablanca Valley

58510,US,"This is the producer's highest and most westerly vineyard site. It holds back from the start, still tightly wound and somewhat reduced on the nose. As it opens, ethereal layers of wild strawberry, green tea and lacings of herb and white pepper unveil to tremendous effect.",93,85.0,California

58520,US,"Give this young Cabernet a good decant before you serve, because it's a big, brooding wine that needs some air to open up.

58526,US,"A hulking, concentrated and full-bodied wine, given plenty of time in new French oak, it has a power and intensity that's hard to decipher at first sip.

58543,Italy,"Aromas of ripe blackberry, brown spice and fragrant blue flower waft from the glass. A blend of 50% Negroamaro, 25% Primitivo and 25% Malvasia Nera, the savory, approachable palate delivers black cherry, cranberry, nutmeg and mineral alongside firm tannins.",89,22.0,Southern Italy
58544,US,"Here's a big, ripe and dry Cabernet with flavors of blackberry, molasses and dark chocolate that seem almost overripe due to a touch of raisin. Tannic and full bodied, it's too robust to drink now, so give it 6–8 years in a cellar.",90,25.0,California
58545,Germany,"Herbaceous, lemony tones reverberate from start to finish on this elegant off-dry Riesling, accenting sweet, juicy peach and tangerine flavors. Hints of smoke and tea leaf add some complexity, along with a lime-pith astringency on the finish.",90,25.0,Mosel
58546,US,"Merlot has never been St. Supery's strong suit, and this wine shows the winery's continuing struggle. The cool vintage has produced a very dry, tart wine, with green olive, tobacco and herb flavors alongside the black cherry and oak tones.",86,50.0,California
58547,South Africa,"A bright, minerally nose and clean, elegant flavors give this wine from cool-climate Elgin a sophisticated edge. Though the wine has a refined character, there's still an abundance of rich tropical fruit and citrus flavors. The finish is refreshing and subtle.",88,14.0,Elgin

58549,US,"From vineyards on Howell Mountain and Oak Knoll, this wine is bristling in acidity, with a taste of lemon peel and grapefruit. Secondary characteristics of peas and pineapple confound as a stony texture adds breadth.",86,30.0,California
58550,Austria,"An herbal edge of lemon balm plays amidst the citrus and pineapple-scented nose of this immensely concentrated Riesling. Pleasantly bitter notes of apple and pear peel add an earthy quality and a firm structure that allows citrus aromas of lemon zest, pink grapefruit and tangerine peel to soar.",93,77.0,Kremstal
58551,Australia,"Only released in top vintages, this is Jim Barry's luxury cuvée of Cabenet Sauvignon. It does see plenty of oak, so it shows impressive notes of baking spices, vanilla and brown sugar, but it backs those with ample dark fruit. It's elegant despite its size, with a fine-grained tannins lingering on the finish. Drink now–2025, and possibly beyond.",93,83.0,South Australia
58552,France,"Heavily dominated by Merlot, this is a generous and full-bodied wine. Wood aging has left its mark in the burnt, toasty character.

58555,Chile,"Hailing from a vineyard planted 900 meters above sea level, this Syrah-led blend is black as night, gaseous on the nose and loaded with heavy, ripe berry flavors.

58559,US,"Erath's Juliard bottling has a bit more stiffness and muscle than the wide-open Hyland, but tails off too quickly to be considered as a cellar candidate.

58571,US,"Perhaps because of the cold vintage, the wine is unsatsifyingly dry, tannic and acidic, showing only hints of sour cherry candy, cola and green mint tea. Not an ager, so drink up.",86,48.0,California
58572,US,"Not quite as rich and balanced as in past vintages, the 2004 is a bit ordinary in blackberry and cherry flavors. The tannins are fairly powerful, and the wine, which clocks in at over 15% alcohol, feels hot and peppery.",85,50.0,California
58573,US,"Dry and rich in tannins, but not quite ripe, with a vegetal note to the blackberries and cherries. Drink now.",84,50.0,California
58574,US,"Profoundly rich and complex, a blend of all five Bordeaux varietals.

The tannins are soft, but there is a boost of firm acidity that suggests ageability.",92,50.0,California
58575,US,"Bold and spicy, this vineyard selection impresses with dusty tangy red and purple fruits. They are elevated with pineapple and citrus flavors from supporting acidity. The length and complexity are excellent, as is the entire lineup of 2014 Pinots from J. Christopher.",92,60.0,Oregon

58577,Argentina,"This is mellow on the nose, with a mix of minerality and standard apple aromas. The palate feels fresh due to cutting acidity, while apple, peach and melon flavors lead to a mild, healthy finish. Frankly, there's not much difference between this and Trivento's basic 2012 Reserva Chardonnay, which costs $10 less.",87,21.0,Mendoza Province

58580,Argentina,"Sweet oak and vanilla aromas are front and center on a jammy bouquet that also features black plum and blackberry scents. This blend of Malbec, Petit Verdot and Tannat feels full, lifted and balanced.

58581,US,"A touch of concentration helps this wine stand out from the pink pack. The color is a vibrant pink, the aromas recall watermelon and the flavors and body are hefty enough to pair well with everything from salads to salmon to fried chicken.",87,17.0,California
58582,Germany,"Peaches and honeysuckle seem to perfume this lavish, aromatic semi-sweet Riesling. The palate is lush with sweet yellow cherries and peaches, yet balanced by sunny lemon acidity and a crush of minerals that linger on the finish.",91,28.0,Mosel

58584,France,"Smooth and rich, a wine that seems soft rather than focused. Hints of wood add to the attraction, while pear and lychee flavors give further ripeness. It probably needs several months, or a year, to come together.",90,,Burgundy
58585,France,"Very perfumed Riesling, full of white flowers, hedgerow fruits and fragrant acidity. There is a good granular texture to balance this fruitiness giving a ripe wine that can be drunk now.",88,16.0,Alsace

58589,US,"Richness is the operative word with this 100% Cabernet. That's due to the exceptional ripeness, reflected in opulent blackberry, cherry and milk chocolate flavors, as well as in the high alcohol, which gives it a heady, porty heat. Not an ager, but an opulent Napa Cab to drink now.",91,125.0,California
58590,France,"The wine is stalky with tight tannins and just a touch of spicy wood. It has acidity, bitter cherry fruits and structure. Drink now.",87,27.0,Loire Valley

58594,Germany,"Perfumed on the nose with heady yellow florals and stonefruit, this is one stunner of a Riesling.

Penetrating and pure in focus, yet remarkably delicate in texture, it finishes long with layers of crushed-stone minerality.",94,58.0,Mosel

58597,South Africa,"This is an interesting red blend made from 61% Shiraz, 27% Petit Verdot and 12% Sangiovese. It's dense yet tight, with notes of small dark berries and tart cherries that are hit by accents of leather, sweet spice and pressed violets. The balance is superb, thanks to medium, well-integrated tannins, ample acidity and a pleasantly fruited finish.",90,20.0,Stellenbosch
58598,US,"Starting off quite reductive, it opens to reveal notes of lime leaf, mineral and freshly peeled tangerine. The palate drinks dry but doesn't have the acid to entirely stand it up.",85,24.0,Washington
58599,France,"With a good sense of structure, this bottling, formerly called Vieilles Vignes, comes from 55-year-old vines. It is textured, with some firm tannins as well as ripe plum flavors and acidity. The wine is still developing and will be better from 2016.",89,40.0,Burgundy
58600,France,"Among the most northerly of the run of Beaune premier crus, the wine is structured but the structure is cushioned by the ripe red-berry fruits to give a generous wine. Backed by tannins, the wine will age well. Drink from 2022.",93,80.0,Burgundy
58601,US,"The extra heat of Calistoga shows in this wine's softness, which limits its ageability. On the other hand, it's supremely ripe in blackberries, cherries, currants and milk chocolate, while oak adds elaborate layers of buttered toast and caramel. Drink now–2015.",92,75.0,California
58602,Chile,"This is fresh, with good pungency and a mix of passion fruit and bell pepper aromas. A scouring mouthfeel pulls no punches, while grassy, slightly bitter flavors of arugula and lemon-lime finish citrusy and tangy.",87,13.0,Casablanca Valley
58603,Italy,"This blend of Cabernet Sauvignon, Nero d'Avola and Merlot opens with bright intensity, especially in terms of the quality of its fruit aromas. The palate is smooth and silky, with a long, fruit-driven finish.",88,17.0,Sicily & Sardinia
58604,US,"The winery's top cuvée, this offers barely ripe rhubarb and cranberry fruit flavors, with heavy tannins tasting of green coffee. The finish has a slight bitterness, but the wine overall shows medium concentration and depth, and could be cellared for a few more years to smooth it out.",87,45.0,Oregon
58605,Austria,"Tulip blossom, fresh green apple and feisty lemon acidity play on the palate of this wine that offers flavorful refreshment. The lasting length suggests hidden depths worth plumbing.",90,38.0,Südsteiermark
58606,US,"One of the most ripe, opulent and unctuous of the Anderson Valley wines, this full-bodied bottling smells and tastes like cinnamon, cherries, milk chocolate and brown sugar, but not as sweet as that sounds. The texture is very broad and mouth-coating and the alcohol feels on the high side, giving a feeling of power with polish.",92,82.0,California
58607,US,"This wine is five years old and is starting to show its age. Aromas of dried tobacco, tomato leaf, mesquite and vanilla are followed by velvety-feeling fruit flavors that show a pleasing persistence. Drink now.",89,38.0,Washington

58609,France,"Solid and textured, this is a firm wine with a bright future. It has weight from its tannins as well as ripe berry fruits that shine through. Delicate acidity lightens the load. It does need to age, so drink from 2016.",89,15.0,Bordeaux

58613,US,"Crisp, coastal acidity dominates this wine, making it mouth-wateringly tart. May be too much for some folks, but it's quite elegant, with good cherry, black raspberry and cola flavors enriched with a touch of smoky oak.",88,36.0,California
58614,South Africa,"Fresh and vibrant, this offers lively notes of green gooseberry as well as lime pith and leaf that continue on to the light, zippy palate. It's clean, bright and easy to drink, with a saline accent on the close. Drink now.",88,19.0,Western Cape

58616,US,"Strong aromas of blackberry extract, cedar, nose-tickling herbs and a bit of bacon fat mark the nose of this release from a winery whose 84-year-old namesake died in October 2014.

58618,US,"The color is about as deep as wine gets, virtually black except for a thin red-purple rim. The aromas resemble black cherries, even black olives and the flavors are as rich as blackberry jam, but without the sweetness. So this is a bold, full-bodied wine with lots of well-integrated tannins that make it astringent to drink at this young age. It will be best after 2020, when it will have softened and gained more diverse flavors.",91,70.0,California
58619,US,"Smoothly seductive, this wine showcases an amazing site with great skill, coaxing high-toned squeezes of mandarin orange, honeysuckle and anise from a foundation of balance and acidity. Luxurious, the oak plays a supporting role, never distracting from a core of freshness and finesse.",94,60.0,California
58620,US,"Strong in primary fruit now. Overwhelms with the ripest blackberries, cherries and red currants, with lots of toasty oak, and a hint of herbs. The tannins are dusty and soft. Fine if you like your Cabs young, but should benefit from 3–5 years in the cellar.",90,50.0,California
58621,US,"This 100% Cabernet is tannic, acidic and dry, yet remarkably fruity as well. It shows a classic cool-climate Napa structure, with blackberry, currant and oak flavors. It's not yet ready to drink, so give it at least six years in the cellar, and possibly far longer.",90,75.0,California

58623,Argentina,"Saline-based aromas suggest sea shells, accompanied by notes of vanilla and stone fruits. This wine has a lively yet full palate that fits the Tupungato style. A layer of oak flavor sits atop pineapple, melon and peach notes. It's woody and tastes of honeyed tropical fruits on the finish.",87,18.0,Mendoza Province
58624,US,"Don't drink this Chardonnay too cold, as it needs a little while in the glass to show its stuff. Right off the bat, it's austere, but when it airs, the tropical fruit, orange and oak complexities come out. The parts have not yet come together, though, so give it 3–4 years to develop.",90,58.0,California

58627,US,"The estate's reserve, this pure Cabernet Sauvignon has been given 22 months in new French oak. Sculpted and well-defined, it offers raspberry and blueberry fruit, set in lovely tannins. The finish shows details of orange blossoms, citrus and coffee grounds. At this time, the new oak is a bit overwhelming, but additional bottle age or decanting for several hours will help to balance it out.",90,95.0,Washington
58628,US,"One has to dig deep to discover much in the way of aromas on this rosé, which is made of indeterminate grapes. Dry, dark pink in color, its flavors are quite simple.",82,17.0,California
58629,US,"This 2005 Syrah from Morrison Lane seems a bit lackluster compared with previous efforts. This is smoky and tight, a tannic wine with flavors of lead pencil, green tea and earth. But the fruit is quite light, tart, and does not seem to sync up with the heaviness of the tannins.",87,32.0,Washington
58630,US,"The cool 2010 vintage has allowed Roadhouse to express its focused and elegant approach to Pinot Noir with great success. Black Label is a small-production barrel selection. Silky and delicate in the mouth, it features dramatically layered flavors: cola, exotic spice, sweet red cherry and ripe raspberry. It's a little hot on the finish, which limits its score.",92,55.0,California
58631,France,This wine has some tannins that give structure as well as young fruitiness. A definite dry edge comes from the fruit as well as wood aging. The wood also brings out some bitterness that needs to soften. Drink from 2016.,88,,Burgundy
58632,Australia,"A good wine...but disappointing given the high quality of the winery's Chardonnay. This is a plump, medium-bodied Pinot with a somewhat coarse texture and rather simple sour-cherry flavors.",84,48.0,Victoria

58634,Germany,"Earthy, slightly sweaty top notes dissipate with aeration to reveal striking yellow peach and blossom aromas on this sprightly kabinett. Delicate honey augments the sunny, succulent palate. The finish is zesty and bright, extended by a streak of tangerine acidity.",90,29.0,Rheinhessen

58638,France,"Maucamps is situated in Macau, just south of Margaux, giving it a stylish character. It has weight, of course, but this is given perspective by the structured black fruits and supporting tannin. A dry core will allow the wine to age. Drink from 2018.",90,30.0,Bordeaux
58639,US,"A nicely crafted debut from a new Walla Walla boutique. The blend—two thirds Cabernet Sauvignon, one third Syrah—is becoming a classic in Walla Walla. This wraps delicious caramel around bright berries and plums. It's nicely focused, smooth and compact, but feels like a wine that will flesh out with a bit more bottle age.",90,19.0,Washington
58640,US,"This tastes soft and simple now, although considering the vineyard sourcing, that could be misleading. There's a core of raspberry and cherry fruit, with intriguing forest notes of dried pine needles and mushrooms. The acidity is just right, neither bright nor too soft. The wine isn't showing much now, but could be a sleeper. Try after 2015.",88,48.0,California

58642,US,"Herbal mint and strawberry counterbalance the density of oak and tannin that is the foundation of this wine.

58644,Australia,"The Limestone Coast, which encompasses the noted regions of Coonawarra and Padthaway, is known for its Cabernet and its big gum trees. There's certainly more than a bit of mint to this wine, but there are also notes of cassis and even a hint of bell pepper.

58645,US,Aromas of bright pink roses and soft cherry fruit are a bit shy on the nose but pretty when they do arise. The palate of this 85% Syrah and 15% Viognier blend shows raspberry fruit and lime-rind tartness.,87,28.0,California

58647,France,"This 55% Cabernet Sauvignon, 45% Merlot wine is ripe and spicy. Solid fruit gives a juicy character along with a strong sense of structure.

58653,France,"Almost black in color, this is a Syrah to rival the most concentrated wines from the Rhône. It has weight, richness and power, its dark damson fruit flavors and tannins almost lost in all this intense fruit. Age for 3–4 years or drink now.",89,18.0,Southwest France

58657,US,"This pure Cabernet blends first-class fruit from Loess, Windrow and Cold Creek. It's spicy and tight, with black cherry fruit at the core. It's back-loaded with toast and caramel flavors from aging in a mix of French and American oak.",90,41.0,Washington
58658,US,"This has an elegant, fruity, lightly spicy profile. Red cherry and nutmeg aromas meld with fresh and pure fruit flavors like red cherry and raspberry shaded by cinnamon and clove. It also offers a silky-smooth texture and medium body.",90,15.0,California
58659,France,"This is a rich, rounded and concentrated wine. Good structure comes both from the wood aging and from the acidity of the apple and apricot fruits. Developing slowly, it will become an impressive, ripe wine. Drink from 2018. The grapes come from the highest vineyard in Chassagne, just under the woods.",91,45.0,Burgundy
58660,France,"From the smallest of the Saint-Emilion satellite villages, this wine has swathes of black fruit aromas that go well with its firm tannins, dense blackberry flavors and concentration. Ripe Merlot dominates the blend, giving both structure and fruit. Drink from 2021.",91,27.0,Bordeaux
58661,Germany,"Ripe sweet peach and nectarine flavors are slightly caramelized in this semidry Riesling. Its spry zesty demeanor is deeply refreshing though, finishing on a revitalizing citrus note. Drink now through 2018.",88,12.0,Mosel
58662,Australia,"It's full-bodied and a little warm (14% alcohol), but this also boasts baked apple and citrus fruit and restrained, pencilly, toasty oak. It's lush and mouthfilling without being overblown; rich without being exotic—a well made New World Chard.",88,14.0,South Australia
58663,Germany,"Just a touch of honey-lemon sweetness is enough to make this zesty, citrus-focused Riesling lip smackingly delicious. Fresh, green herb and lime notes reverberate through a strong finish. Drinks well now but should meld nicely over the next five years.",91,22.0,Mosel
58664,France,"Crisp and elegant in feel, this has apricot and peach flavors that are balanced by the tight structure and the green-fruit-like acidity. The layers of toast have integrated with the ebullient fruit character and the taut, minerally finish. For aging 3–4 years.",92,,Burgundy

With finely ground tannins and near-perfect coastal acidity, it's addictively likeable. Now–2012.",93,60.0,California
58668,US,"Hard to exaggerate the beauty of this mountain-grown wine, which is based on Cabernet Sauvignon but contains the other four classic Bordeaux varieties. Although it's very tannic, those tannins are remarkably soft. Nearly all-new oak provides a framework of smoky caramel, delicious enough, but just an accompaniment to the blackberries, black currants, cherries and dark chocolate. A fantastic wine for drinking now, and should last for many years in the cellar.",96,75.0,California
58669,US,"A light mauve in color, this Pinot Noir-based wine shows boisterous plum fruit, macerated strawberries and a hint of clove on the ripe nose, making it more entrée-ready than apéritif-aimed.

58671,US,"This wine is a blend of fruit from Seven Hills, Loess, Mill Creek Upland, Leonetti Old Block and Serra Pedace. Aromas of mineral, black cherry, incense, barrel spice and scorched earth lead to a full-bodied textured palate full of black-fruit flavors and tightly wound tannins. It drinks quite young now, needing some time to come into its own. Best from 2024–2029.",93,95.0,Washington
58672,US,"Here's a Cabernet to lay down in the cellar for 6–8 years—or even longer. Two things mark it: the extremely ripe, concentrated blackberry and black currant fruit, and the hefty tannins.

58678,US,"A butterscotch note hits the nose first, before fading to reveal scents of tea, leather and cedary spices.

58684,Chile,"Plump, buttery aromas of apple and peach suggest popcorn. Typical of a Lapostolle Chardonnay, this feels a bit chunky and oily. Flavors of pineapple are slightly syrupy and oaky, while this tastes of honey, butter, stone fruits and mango on the finish.",87,14.0,Rapel Valley
58685,US,"The price reflects the fame of the vineyard, not the quality of the wine. It's too big and extracted in cherry and raspberry jam flavors, and 70% new French oak just makes it taste sweeter and heavier. Earns extra credit for ripe power, and can be described as quintessentially Pisoni.",89,85.0,California
58686,US,"The lovely bouquet of blackberry jam, oak with mint, cedar, and black olives draws you in. Broad and rich on the palate, with ample but fine tannins. Great depth of dark-berry fruit, with coffee and cedar shadings. The explosive finish just keeps going as intriguing sweet-tart fruit and bitter chocolate notes please all the way out. Best to hold six to nine years.",95,125.0,California

58689,US,"This is quite an impressive Cabernet. The wine rivals an intense Napa Cabernet, with it's tannic structure and its bold flavors of blackberry, black currant and licorice that have been exquisitely oaked. It's elegantly drinkable now despite the power, but should comfortably glide through at least the next eight years.",95,75.0,California
58690,Italy,This wine has a firm tannic structure and fresh acidity but the fruit is drying up fast. You'll also detect the warmth of alcohol.,86,27.0,Tuscany

58692,Italy,"A blend of 70% Syrah and 30% Grenache, this robust red opens with aromas of ripe, black-skinned fruit, cedar and ground pepper. The concentrated palate doles out fleshy black cherries and black currants accented by licorice and allspice. Velvety tannins and the heat of evident alcohol provide the framework.

58693,US,"Entirely estate-grown, this is a gorgeous wine—crisp in red cherry, pomegranate and floral tones, with a fleshy, textured and juicy palate.

58696,US,"If you're used to soft, ripe Napa Valley Cabernet, this one, grown just over the Lake County border, will strike you as dry and unyielding. The tannins are pronounced, giving it a hard bite. But it's rich and deep in crème de cassis, the sort of wine that seems ageworthy. Take a gamble and put it in your cellar for 6–8 years.",90,28.0,California
58697,US,"The straightforward Cabernet fruit is immersed in new oak, so the dominant flavors of smoke, toast, chocolate and espresso all seem to emanate from the barrel aging. Otherwise it is a simple and perfectly pleasant, no-frills red.",85,36.0,Washington
58698,US,"An ultrarich Cabernet that shows the pedigree of its vineyard.

58701,US,"Bright boysenberry fruit is blended with aromas of white pepper, oregano, nettle and rosemary on the underripe nose of this Syrah. The cracked peppercorn flavor shows prominently on the sip, along with elderberry, pine and forest floor. The tannins are oddly sticky.",88,20.0,California
58702,France,"The high altitude vineyards of Luberon can yield some thirst-quenching rosés, of which this is a very good example. Hints of crushed stone and barely-ripe peaches finish on a refreshing note of fresh lime juice. Drink now.",88,16.0,Rhône Valley

58704,US,"This collaboration between American winemakers Greg Brewer and Steve Clifton and Japanese entrepreneur Takahide Sugimoto is stunningly high-toned and buttoned-up at first, with sour cream, yogurt, crushed ant, gunmetal, flint and quinine elements on the nose.

58707,US,"The tannins give this wine a lockdown feeling, making it hard and astringent. But the fruit is strong and jammy, suggesting raspberries, cherries and blackberries. Made from Syrah, Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot, it's forward and one-dimensional now, but delicious, and unlikely to improve with age.",88,40.0,California
58708,France,"This wine is rather too jammy and ripe for its own good. It does have acidity, but it is also soft without the essential structure. It's not a wine for aging.",85,,Burgundy

58710,US,"Very ripe in cassis, with plenty of smoky oak influence and a spicy, dry finish. This is a bold, tannic young wine, tight and astringent in youth. It needs time in the cellar to soften and meld. Should be best between 2009 and 2011, and live far longer.",91,45.0,California

58865,Chile,"Neutral white-fruit aromas are slightly oxidized. This Chardonnay feels chunky and creamy, with only moderate acidity. Sweet-leaning flavors suggest canned pineapple, while this feels syrupy and tastes like papaya on a soft finish.",86,17.0,Colchagua Valley
58866,US,"Although it's 100% varietal and comes from one of the state's oldest Cabernet vineyards, this wine is somewhat blue-fruited for the variety, with notes of plum and mountain blueberry along with herb, graphite, espresso and spice. The palate shows more of the same, bringing a sense of restraint and polish along with lightly grainy tannins that need some time to stretch their legs. It doesn't scream Cabernet but it still brings plenty of appeal. Best after 2022.",90,75.0,Washington

58870,US,"This wine shows a tough unripeness that makes it hard to appreciate.

Hard to see this wine aging, so drink soon.",86,45.0,California
58871,France,"The aromatic richness of ripe pears rises from the glass. The same rich fruit is joined by a lively streak of lemon freshness on the palate where it is met with a judicious dollop of residual sweetness.

58880,US,"All the parts of this juvenile wine have not begun to come together. You have ripe, jammy blackberry, cassis and blueberry flavors, firm tannins, evident new oak, and crisp acidity.

58882,US,"A blend of Cabernet Sauvignon (55%), Merlot (36%) and Petit Verdot from the Seven Hills and Loess vineyards, aromas of dried high-toned herb, cocoa and barrel spice intermingle on a wine that has yet to fully reveal its charms.

58891,Australia,"Byrne is a relatively young Clare Valley producer, having made its own wines only since 2008. This Reserve Cabernet features some charred oak and espresso notes on the nose, then ripe, plummy fruit on the palate.

58899,Austria,"Delicious notions of ripe greengages haunt the nose, alongside fragrant orange peel. The palate is still taut and tight, sprightly and streamlined, as if powered and propelled forward by invisible citrus force. There is such drive and precision here, you almost feel movement and speed. The finish is clean but clearly this is for the longer run.

58974,US,"This could be classified as a red wine—it's as dark as some Pinot Noir. But the winery recommends chilling it, so we'll call it a blush. The blend is not disclosed. The flavors are rich with strawberries, persimmons and limes.",86,20.0,California
58975,France,"Structured and concentrated, it has a silky richness that is very Volnay, while at the same time giving the bright fruits of the year. The final tastes are smoke and crisp acidity.",92,85.0,Burgundy

58977,US,"Your basic California Chardonnay, soft, with oak-infused pear and orange flavors, brightened by pleasant Carneros acidity.",83,20.0,California
58978,US,"Caramelized oak finds a companion in tangy acidity in this full-bodied, lushly concentrated white from various vineyard sources. A taste of baked pear gives it a richness that veers on sweet upfront before it opens and expands on the palate into a broader spectrum of rounded texture and a lilt of anise.",90,35.0,California
58979,US,"This is a soft, silky and ultimately impressive wine, darkly brooding in mushroomy, forested earth and an undeniable luxuriousness of cherry cola. Medium bodied and easy to enjoy, it's a complete wine that's firm in minerality and tension.",90,40.0,California
58980,US,"This has so much rich earth and minerality, it's like a journey deep into a mine. It's noted the vines were planted in 1970, and the wine does have that old-vine concentration of fruit in the form of massively intense blackberries. Then there's the smoky new oak, which adds such a lusciously sweet jacket of buttered toast. Tannic and tight in the way of Diamond Mountain Cabernets, this should begin to come into its own after 2016.",95,80.0,California
58981,US,"A soft, nicely oaked Merlot with flavors of baked plum and ripe blackberry. Full-bodied in every sense of the word, with just a sprinkling of spice on the finish.",86,24.0,California
58982,US,"Enormously rich, with intense blackberry and cherry jam, currant, dark chocolate and bacon flavors, wrapped into firm tannins. The vineyard is in a warm, high elevation part of the county. Delicious now, and should acquire additional bottle interest over the next six years.",93,37.0,California
58983,US,"This wine starts out seemingly reduced, with aromas of sulfur and funk in front of berry and smoke. The palate is lightly styled with grainy tannins. There are good things going on if the reduction blows off.",88,19.0,Washington
58984,Germany,"Light as gossamer, this nimble off-dry Riesling enlivens the palate with delicate bursts of lemon and lime accented by blossom and pear. Brisk and clean on the finish, it's best enjoyed for it's youthful refreshment.",88,18.0,Pfalz
58985,US,"It has silky texture, brisk acidity and pleasant cherry, cola, tobacco and spice flavors.",84,18.0,California
58986,Spain,"Tropical aromas are friendly but basic. A melony feeling palate is low on acidity, thus flavors of honeydew and mango seem mushy. A soft, mealy finish with a papaya-like flavor is the last act. Year after year this unoaked Chardonnay barely gets by.",83,12.0,Northern Spain
58987,France,"A blend of Cabernet Franc and Tannat, this is spicy, smoky and herbal. It is dense, with a green, stalky edge that comes from the acidity and black tannins. Age for two years.",88,24.0,Southwest France
58988,France,"Attractive aromas of sweet grass, melon rind and baby's breath lead the nose of this dainty wine, with supporting fruity nuances of white raspberry, cherry and peach. The mouthfeel is light and refreshing, with pleasant acidity and a juicy, mouthwatering finish. Enjoy this quenching rosé now.",87,17.0,Languedoc-Roussillon

58990,US,"There's a stunning amount of action on the nose of this bottling by Josh Jensen, with dried jasmine, lemon curd, squeezed tangerine, key lime pie and a warm touch of nuttiness. Rounded stonefruit and apple blossoms show on the palate, which is bound by a grapefruit pith grip and features a steadily growing salty character that comes on smooth and strong. A botanical twist hits the finish.",93,40.0,California
58991,France,"This lively, crisp wine gives both intense acidity and great fruitiness. It's bright, with a line of fresh red currant flavors that are delicious and drinkable right now.",88,14.0,Provence

58995,US,"A bit reduced when first opened, it throws off scents of burnt rubber, then slowly opens into a roundly fruity, lightly toasty Pinot with a firmly tannic base. Flavors of Dr. Pepper drift through the midpalate. Give it a good decanting and it's fine for near-term consumption.",89,60.0,Oregon
58996,US,"Sweetly aromatic of jasmine, this Chardonnay has a core of honey, apple and caramel, and is pleasantly crisp and balanced. Accessible and well-priced, it's a solid and friendly go-to white for just about any occasion.",85,10.0,California
58997,US,"Though it didn't see any oak, this wine—a sister brand of the pioneering Santa Barbara Winery—presents rich and complex aromas of saffron, seared lemon rinds, rosemary and roasted chicken.

58998,Canada,"Half barrel fermented, and all oak-aged (roughly two-thirds new), this cloaks the lush fruit flavors of pineapple, peach and nectarine in a wash of caramel. The wine remains well proportioned, with acids and barrel toast playing a supporting role.",89,30.0,British Columbia
58999,US,"Aromas like jam and maple syrup and equally ripe, generous flavors give this medium-bodied wine an easy appeal. The texture is soft for this type, the flavors are not too deep and the finish is light.",84,8.0,California
59000,US,"Not for fans of rich Chardonnays, this is a very dry, acidic bottling. It's more about clean mouthfeel and scour than hedonism. What fruit there is suggests limes, pears and brisk minerals, while smoky oak and lees contribute toasty, buttery, creamy notes. A distinguished and elegant wine that defines cool-climate coastal conditions. Grows more complex and interesting as it warms in the glass.",93,38.0,California
59001,Portugal,"Lurton's first Grande Escolha from estate vineyards is purple and saturated, with grapey, floral aromatics touched up by spice.

59003,US,"Though not designated as such, this is a reserve-level effort, as noted by the special label (with Owen Roe in large, old-fashioned cursive lettering) and its overall concentration.

It's a powerful wine that is already drinking well, and should continue to do so into the late 2020s.",93,85.0,Oregon
59004,France,"This is the first vintage of this new purchase by Sylvie Cazes, a leading figure in the Bordeaux wine scene. A classed growth, it's richly fruity yet structured and firm, with dense tannins and layers of delicious black fruit. With its tannins still well at the fore, it will need to age further, so drink from 2022.",93,50.0,Bordeaux
59005,Germany,"Zesty pepper and herb aromas accent this elegant but fruity Pinot Noir. Tart red cherry and berry flavors are crisply concentrated, fringed by fine tannins and a lingering murmur of briar wood. Drink now through 2019.",89,15.0,Pfalz
59006,France,"This monopole within the Chablis grand cru vineyards produces top Chablis. In 2006, the wine is powerful, but layered with intense minerality, a flinty character on top of the ripe white and yellow fruits. It has concentration, a depth of flavor that is impressive. It will age well.",94,90.0,Burgundy

59009,US,"Principally sourced from the Cold Creek Vineyard, this reserve-level Merlot does not quite come up to past vintages. It's balanced and firm, with red and black fruits that currently seem overtaken by the time (22 months) spent in 78% new French oak.",89,50.0,Washington
59010,US,"Not clear what the blend is on this red wine, because the winery doesn't tell us. But it's very good, showing rich black cherry, red currant, mocha and spice flavors. What a great price for such a nice, drinkable wine.",88,18.0,California
59011,France,"A soft, fruity wine, touched with vanilla and citrus. It is full, ripe, some tropical fruits and showing a final fresh acidity.",88,,Burgundy

59013,US,"Pink lemonade and cherry pie mesh together into a strong, slightly boozy aroma on this adventurous blend of 30% Petite Sirah, 30% Syrah, 30% Grenache and 10% Tannat from Matt Villard's Petite Sirah-focused project. Cherry and orange juice dominate the palate.",86,18.0,California
59014,France,"With a medicinal hint, this is a wine that is all potential. At the moment, it is firm, dry and darkly tannic. The weight gives the promise, offering rich fruitiness in the future. Drink this impressive, concentrated wine from 2016.",90,46.0,Bordeaux
59015,US,"An unusually bright-gold color and aromas like vanilla and nutmeg signal a complex style for this unusually textured and nicely viscous wine that is technically light bodied in terms of alcohol. Balanced out by good acidity, it is not overtly fruity but goes for complexity and spiciness that linger on the finish.",90,19.0,California
59016,US,"Textural and spicy, this has a subtle mix of herb, salts, stem, leaf and wild berry flavors. It's fascinating and complex, with the sort of mystifying sex appeal that only Pinot Noir seems to be capable of. It spent 18 months in 30% new French oak to good effect.",92,48.0,Oregon
59017,Austria,"Initially restrained, this opens into whirls of lemon, lime and pink grapefruit peel with an almost fizzy zestiness. Refreshment travels along the palate in total precision and linearity, with a rush of citrusy excitement.",93,30.0,Wachau
59018,Chile,"Airy smelling, with citrus and grass aromas brewing underneath. Has a wet, simple, refreshing feel and rather intense flavors of lime, tangerine and other citrus fruits. Cuts a direct path.",85,11.0,Casablanca Valley
59019,France,"A wine of architectural strength and classical proportions, this has straight lines that mark the packed, concentrated fruits, which are sustained by its tannins. This is certainly the best wine that Léoville-Poyferré has produced, sumptuous while so finely structured.",98,92.0,Bordeaux
59020,US,"Nice and drily balanced, this is pretty tannic, with blackberry, cherry, leather, carob, coffee and peppery spice flavors that finish with an intriguing touch of tangerine rind. Drink now.",86,13.0,California

59023,Spain,"More red than dark, with semisweet aromas of candy, strawberry and a bit of grassy green. The palate is easygoing and creamy, with milk chocolate and berry flavors along with overt wood-driven spice. Finishes with drying tannins, another wave of oak and just enough snap to keep it moving in the right direction. Good but not great by Priorat standards.",86,23.0,Catalonia
59024,US,"A blend of 54% Merlot with smaller percentages of Cabernet Sauvignon (28%) and Cabernet Franc (18%), this is a nicely structured red that's soft, accessible and juicy, with notes of cranberry and cassis liqueur coming to the fore.",88,29.0,California
59025,France,"Bel-Air is owned by the Cazes family of Château Lynch-Bages in Pauillac, and the pedigree of the winemaking shows. A rich, almost opulent wine, tempered with tannins. Flavors of dark black figs, herbs and wood come together harmoniously. It has a tense edge of tannin that promises aging.",90,25.0,Bordeaux
59026,US,"This classic Washington blend is 60% Merlot, 30% Cabernet Franc and 10% Syrah—a perfect storm of power, precision and compact fruit. From the Merlot comes a thickly generous layer of strawberry/black cherry fruit. The Franc beefs up the tannins and adds highlights of coffee grounds, while the Syrah lifts the wine's aromatics and lightly spices it with pepper. Masterful blending by Andrew Rich.",91,20.0,Washington
59027,France,"This rounded, wood-aged wine has just the right amount of structure and delicious acidity to accompany the full red- and black-berry notes. It's refreshing, while still concentrated and age worthy.",89,12.0,Bordeaux

59029,US,"Despite its youth, this is a soft, round, totally accessible wine with pretty flavors of sassafras, pie cherries and cooked plums. It skirts close to an impression of jam, and almost begs for near-term consumption. Don't hold back.",89,24.0,Oregon
59030,Germany,"While the nose of this Riesling is fresh with scents of orange zest and berries, the palate is unctuously ripe and rich with sweet tropical fruit. It's a lush, easy-going sip but lively with acidity and irresistably tasty.",87,17.0,Mosel
59031,US,"Imagine a Sauvignon Blanc with the weight of Chardonnay, and that's what you get with this single-vineyard wine. It's amazing, because the wine never saw oak. Still, it has a vanilla richness on top of pineapple, peach, anise and honeysuckle flavors. Maybe the correct comparison is of a white Cabernet Sauvignon, with the complexity that implies. What a great value.",93,17.0,California
59032,US,"This is an inky-black wine, with soft, jammy flavors of blackberries, cherries, dark chocolate and oak. The tannins are mountain thick but as refined as modern winemaking can make them. And the finish? Sweet and dry at the same time, which only a good wine can accomplish. Needs 5–7 years in the cellar.",92,75.0,California

59035,US,"A crush of raspberry and maraschino-cherry perfume persists throughout this pristine pretty Pinot Noir. Punchy red-fruit flavors are concentrated and fresh, gilded by subtle tones of violet, toast and crushed mineral. The finish is long, framed neatly by penetrating but finely grained tannins.",90,25.0,New York
59036,Chile,"Concentrated berry and cassis aromas are lush yet spicy, and come with notes of olive and tobacco. The palate on this blend of Carmenère and Malbec is a touch narrow in feel, but it's not at all thin. Flavors of ripe cherry and cassis reflect a hot vintage, while a mellow finish of medicinal berry flavors confirms the wine's ripe character. Drink through 2018.",91,30.0,Colchagua Valley
59037,US,"A real fruit bomb, with explosive flavors of pineapples, lemons, limes and peaches, accented with sweet smoky oak. Malolactic fermentation adds softer flavors of buttered popcorn.",85,25.0,California

59039,New Zealand,"The Stoneleigh style traditionally favors ripeness over herbaceousness, and the 2008 holds true to form, offering up grapefruit and nectarine aromas and an appealing blend of citrus and stone-fruit flavors.

59056,US,"Bone dry and light, with cranberry, cola and tomato flavors in a silky package. This is a wine that seems to be an expression of its vineyard. It's not a rich wine, nor one to age beyond a year or so. But it possesses an earthy honesty. —S.H.",86,24.0,California
59057,France,"Young and fruity, this is an attractive red- and black-currant-flavored wine. Its youthful stalky character will soften quickly to highlight the fruit. Drink from late 2016.",87,15.0,Bordeaux
59058,France,"The scent of fresh, bruised and baked apples makes for an enticing nose on this wine. Fresh and lively with lemon, the palate has a broader aspect than expected, with some graininess on the midpalate. It finishes dry and fresh.",87,17.0,Alsace
59059,US,"Since 2009, the producer has sourced from this site, a relatively warm pocket of the northern reaches of the appellation. Vibrant in red cherry fruit, it's also layered and velvety smooth, with astructure and density that makes it complex and compelling. The fruit dances in blackberry as well as strawberry, with a subtle herbal undertone.",90,40.0,California
59060,US,"One of the better deals for top-quality Pinot, Steve Dooley's entry-level bottling invites the nose with deep and dark black cherry, grape soda and even blueberry aromas, leveled by a hint of ethereal roasted game and dried sage. The purple note holds into the palate, which shows lavender and other potpourri elements.",92,32.0,California
59061,US,"This opens with juicy cranberry and cherry fruit, remaining concentrated through the core palate. Good as it is, the wine fades more quickly than its reserve siblings, which would suggest drinking this one first while the others gain further time in bottle.",90,65.0,Oregon

59064,US,"Almost as perfect a Stags Leap Cabernet as you can find, showing lush, opulent and immediately appealing flavors. Blackberries, plums, cassis, dark chocolate and sweet oak combine in a spicy swirl. The tannins are fiercely soft, an oxymoron that suggests the wine's complexity. Yet those same tannins are astringent enough to warrant time in the cellar. Hold until 2014, at least.",94,65.0,California

59066,Spain,"Melis is a project backed by wine industry folks from California, but this blend of old-vines Grenache along with Carignan, Syrah and Cabernet Sauvignon is very European. It's heady but well balanced, with smooth edges and not too much fiery attitude, roughness or scratchy tannins. It's forward and big-boned, but there's enough creamy richness to make it friendly.

59084,US,"The winery pulled out all the stops on this Cabernet-based Bordeaux blend, yet the wine is so tannic and sharp now.

59085,New Zealand,"Fuller bodied than the other Kumeu River 2010s, the Coddington Chardonnay displays subtle oak shadings on the nose, then explodes into an array of ripe mango and peach on the palate, underscored by just enough citrus to keep things fresh on the long finish. Drink now–2016.",92,46.0,Kumeu
59086,US,"Aged for 22 months in French oak—one third new—this is 67% Cabernet Sauvignon and 33% Merlot. Nota Bene's wines are not shy about high alcohol, but here the fruit stands up well to the oak treatment and shows no sign of over-ripeness.

59087,US,"Sourced from mature plantings in cool sites, this exemplary Riesling is technically off dry, but retains its apple-fresh snap and tang.

59088,Germany,"Delicate aromas of herb and white peach stand in contrast to the ripe, almost candied yellow peach and mango flavors on the palate of this medium-sweet Riesling. It's juicy and lip smacking but spry and crisp on the finish. Drink now to enjoy its youthful freshness.",89,12.0,Mosel
59089,France,"Tough and defiantly tannic, a hard-edged wine that gives a powerful dry texture. The fruit is less obvious, but has a potential to offer red fruits and fresh acidity. This does need aging, over 4–5 years.",92,,Burgundy

59093,New Zealand,"Crisply acidic, with firm tannins, this is a Pinot Noir that could use 2–3 years of cellaring. By then it should have smoothed out a little, allowing the promising aromas and flavors of plum, leather and spice to blossom.",88,36.0,Central Otago
59094,France,This wine is solid and dense with probably too much extracted tannins. There are only hints of fruitiness. It will soften although it's likely to remain stalky. This is the first vintage in which some of the vineyard was managed organically.,88,33.0,Bordeaux
59095,France,"From vines owned by the Chanson family, this is a wonderfully rich wine, deliciously fruity at the same time. Apple and citrus as well as richer apricots come through powerfully.

59099,New Zealand,"The cherry aromas of this wine are so sweet, so obvious, that they come across as almost candied; thankfully, they're balanced by subtle spice and leather shadings that make it clear that this is wine, not fruit juice. Silky tannins bolster that impression, nicely buffering and extending the finish.",89,39.0,Central Otago

59122,France,"The wine is structured with firm tannins as well as ripe fruit. Juicy and concentrated, it has a spicy character that comes from the wood aging. In the Mayé Eymery family since 1854, the wine is from six parcels on the estate. Give this fresh as well as rich wine until 2019.",86,14.0,Bordeaux
59123,Germany,"The mineralschiefer designation attests to the intensely slatey, mineral sheen that juxtaposes ripe yellow peach and tangerine flavors in this bristling dry Riesling. Kissed by honeysuckle, it's effortlessly elegant, yet deeply satisfying sip after sip.",90,29.0,Mosel
59124,France,"Bottled in a replica of a 19th-century crystal carafe, this wine is a blend of crus from the Montagne de Reims. On the dry side of brut, it has a lively sliced apple and citrus character as well as refreshing, lively acidity. The wine is ready to drink.",90,72.0,Champagne
59125,US,"This is very dry, with flavors of blackberries, cherries, currants and chocolate, plus complex notes of herbs, spices and minerals. The tannins are a wonder—dusty and interesting.

While the currant, red stone fruit and licorice flavors are delicious and complex, it lacks structure. Drink up.",88,52.0,California
59130,US,"The chilly vintage has given this wine a toughness of tannins and acids that makes it difficult to appreciate now. And the toasty, sweet oak has not meshed yet with the fruit, which is rich in black currants and cassis liqueur. All signs point to the cellar. Hold until 2018, at least.",90,85.0,California
59131,US,"A fairly elegant expression of the variety, this wine is bright in cherry kirsch and pretty aromas of rose petal and lavender, structured to age and enjoy with food.

59137,US,"Eric Carucci taps a very cool-climate, biodynamic vineyard originally planted by Syrah legend Bob Lindquist to deliver this tightly wound, age-worthy wine, full of black pepper, tar, violet and dense black currants on the nose.

59141,US,"This is very strong in fruit, tasting like the essence of raspberry and cherry, with penetrating acidity. It has a candied jamminess, although the finish is bone dry. Made from Syrah, Tempranillo and Grenache, it's a fun wine for drinking now with easy fare.",86,30.0,California

59144,Chile,"This is seriously spicy on the bouquet, where a mix of earth, pepper, herbal notes and cassis set up a stocky body with a condensed feel and ample oak.

59145,US,"A little tough and gritty in acids and some uneven, green minty tannins, but there's a lot of cherry and raspberry flavor, and the finish is silky and long. Earns an extra point for the depth of fruit. Drink now.",87,30.0,California
59146,US,"This wine is slightly flabby and overtly ripe, making for a dull experience on the palate.",84,35.0,California

59150,US,"A flamboyant Cabernet. Flavors of blackberry jam, currants, mocha and sweet, smoky oak flood the mouth. Fortunately, they're controlled by firm tannins. The sweetness is partly from the glycerine of high alcohol. Drink over the next few years with a great steak.",88,32.0,California
59151,Germany,"Alluring blossom, lemon zest and petrol notes entice on this late-harvest Riesling. It's densely concentrated in sweet-tart pink grapefruit flavor, yet minerally and spry. Finishes with a lingering lacy sweetness.",92,30.0,Mosel

59154,Austria,"The smokiness which on the nose melds seamlessly with red apple flavors becomes more dominant on the palate, revealing a rounded nuttiness. There is a creamy lemon freshness, too: an internationally recogniable Chardonnay style but with the purity of Austrian fruit and continental freshness.",92,45.0,Carnuntum

59177,Germany,"Weil's standard-label Spätlese shares the same core of minerality that its single-vineyard siblings boast, but in a slightly earthier, more rustic style marked by heady whiffs of pollen, saffron and spice.

59178,Italy,"This blend of 90% Sangiovese and 10% Merlot, easily recognizable for its fun label showing antique cars and cyprus trees, has earthy aromas that suggest leafy underbrush, wet soil, woodland berries and plum.

59405,US,"This is Esterlina's off-dry Riesling, and it's as good in its semi-sweet way as a dry bottling. Shows the same brilliant acidity and delicious citrus, peach, wildflower and vanilla flavors, with a complex, honeyed richness.",89,19.0,California
59406,France,This intense wine has great ripe fruit and sweetness to go with the pear and honey flavors. There is great acidity and beautiful fruit character in a gorgeous wine that still keeps its style and freshness.,94,100.0,Alsace
59407,Italy,"Leather, spice, tobacco and tea emerge from the nose of this Sicilian blend of Nero d'Avola, Syrah, Merlot, Cabernet and Petit Verdot. You'll get aromas of clove, allspice and vanilla behind vibrant blueberry and raspberry.",90,,Sicily & Sardinia

59409,Chile,"Rooty and rich at first blush, with dark, black fruit aromas leading the charge. The palate is lively and snappy, with fleshy but short flavors of blackberry, cassis liqueur and coconut. Quite extracted and full but also a touch hard and short, with a few holes in the texture. Carmenère (60%) and Malbec (40%).",88,,Colchagua Valley
59410,Argentina,"The foxy muddled berry aromas are puzzling. This Malbec blend feels narrow and pinched. Hollow lactic foxy red-fruit flavors are crisp but not fully convincing, while abrasive, hard-edged tannins scrape across the finish.",86,50.0,Mendoza Province
59411,US,"Dark and toasty, this wild yeast fermented wine spent 10 months in 10% new Oregon oak. Slightly roasted flavors combine coffee grounds, chunky cherry and cassis. It's a full-bodied full-flavored wine which favors power over finesse.",89,26.0,Oregon
59412,Chile,"Very nice on the nose, with lime, celery and semisour pickle aromas. There is plenty of character to this round, generous single-vineyard SB from Casablanca.

For the money, it's a green-light special.",89,17.0,Casablanca Valley

59414,US,"This has a lively presence in the mouth, with a generous dollop of cinnamon spice. The cranberry/raspberry fruit flavors are supported with tangy acids, and lead into a lingering finish that carries suggestions of metal and stone.

59416,US,"Since this is the winery's largest production Pinot, but still under 1,000 cases, buyers actually have a chance of finding this full-bodied beauty.

Enjoy through 2022.",95,52.0,California
59417,Germany,"Demure apple and pear aromas belie the intensely honeyed peach and tropical fruit flavors that burst from this feather-light nectar. A crush of lemon-lime acidity cuts through the sweetness, leading a long, laser-focused finish. Drinks well now, but will develop well through at least 2025.",92,25.0,Mosel
59418,US,"The name references the mix of fermentation techniques—40% neutral oak, 40% stainless steel and 20% new French barrels. Peach and papaya fruit are accented by a light streak of honey and a whiff of wet stone. This is both nuanced and beautifully proportioned.",92,29.0,Oregon
59419,US,"V. Sattui has been making some pretty good Cabernets, and here's another one.

59421,US,"A consistent stunner vintage after vintage, this elevated Cabernet is velvety smooth and exotically laced in coconut, cola and clove.

59431,Chile,"Casa Silva is a pioneer in the chilly Paredones region, but it has taken them a few years to get this wine right. In 2014, it's there.

Lime, gooseberry and sour orange flavors finish long and true.",90,24.0,Colchagua Valley

59433,France,"With the first hints of maturity on the nose, this is already a rounded and steely wine. The fruit shows as spiced apples and black currants, cut with intense citrus.

59435,Chile,"Match stick, tropical notes and green banana aromas make up the nose. This is dilute in feel, with a hint of generic tropical fruit. Drink now.",84,21.0,Leyda Valley
59436,US,"An individualistic, some would say eccentric wine, made from grapes grown all over the valley. Your first impression is of jammy sweetness: blackberries, cherries, raspberries, oak. Then the tannins kick in, bringing needed dryness. Shows the ripeness of Napa Valley Cabernet, but doesn't seem like an ager. Drink now–2014.",88,70.0,California
59437,US,"Lean and earthy, marked by tobacco and white pepper, tomato and dill aromas and flavors. In the mouth, it's very dry, with easy tannins. There's some tart cherry fruit that shows up in the mid-palate, and the finish turns slightly bitter.",85,19.0,California

59439,US,"Dryness and tannins mark this Cabernet, giving it some austerity and astringency. But lurking deep below the surface is a vast underground landscape of blackberry fruit, cassis, plums, olives, herbs and oak.

59440,US,"Fresh aromas of dark violets, sweet lavender, elderberry and a light teriyaki glaze show on the nose of this extra barrel-aged bottling. It's medium bodied on the palate, where dark fruits meet with elderflower and more purple flowers. It's still a bit reserved.",89,40.0,California
59441,US,"Marked by a lean minerality, this Chablis-style wine is not one of those fat, opulent Chards that dazzles with sheer richness. It's more subtle than that, and more acidic. Structure, in fact, is the name of the game here, with its lemon and lime flavors that barely break into green apples. Fine now, if not served too cold, and for the next 2–4 years. Beyond that, wines of this kind go quickly downhill.",92,65.0,California
59442,Chile,"Despite this having a distinctly green nose, there's enough cherry and currant character along with overall brightness to make this an enjoyable Cab. Oaky flavors of vanilla and cream accent cherry and red plum. The finish is oaky yet bolstered by firm acids.",87,20.0,Maule Valley

59448,US,"Adam Comartin's San Jose-based label shines a bright light on this new appellation. This wine shows blackberry shave ice, black cherries, black pepper, cola and the lifting aromatics of violets on the nose. More black pepper spices up the palate, with the balanced cherry and berry power proving quite distinctive and regal.",92,40.0,California

59451,Spain,"Scratchy plum and raspberry aromas are fresh and forward, while the mouthfeel follows suit; it's juicy, with narrowing acidity and brightness.

59453,New Zealand,"A rather pungent, slightly sweaty nose presages a wine that offers loads of passion fruit flavor. While it lacks a bit of dimension and complexity, this medium-bodied offering will work fine alongside citrusy ceviches and the like.",86,16.0,Marlborough
59454,US,"Peppery, grapey flavors, full body and a rich fine-grained texture make this wine distinctive to taste and soothing to drink. It's a very good example of a GSM, capturing the fullness and generosity of this type of blend made from Grenache, Syrah and Mourvèdre grapes.",89,28.0,California

59457,Spain,"Quite an unusual specimen in that you don't often see Monastrell mixed with Cabernet and Shiraz. The end result is fairly strange and unfamiliar; the nose smells saucy and lean, while the palate is also saucy and a touch medicinal.",83,11.0,Levante
59458,France,"It's certainly tannic and tough at the moment, the wine also has so much fruit. That will allow it to round out, bringing out the black currant fruitiness and resulting in a full, rich and perfumed wine. Wait until 2018.",88,24.0,Bordeaux
59459,Italy,"Pipe tobacco, exotic spice, mature black-skinned berry aromas and a balsamic note slowly emerge on this brawny red. The powerfully built palate delivers raisin, dried morello cherry, licorice, espresso and clove alongside bracing, close-grained tannins that grip the finish.",90,,Veneto

59461,US,"When a rosé pushes past 14% alcohol, that's an indication of a pretty potent wine. Here's a fine example, showcasing ripe strawberry and peach fruit, with excellent concentration and mouth-filling flavors. Using all free-run juice, this is fresh and full-bodied.",90,18.0,Oregon

59472,US,"A good choice for fans of older wines, the Raphael 2002 Merlot shows mature forest floor and earth scents but is still hanging on to some raspberry and blackberry fruit.

59513,Australia,"Has a nice citrus-pear core, but the fruit wears a strange faux-sweetness (really, it tastes like saccharine) that was a little offputting. Still, it's a nice wine, with medium body and nice resiny and creamy notes on the nose.",86,20.0,South Australia

Drink through 2019.",91,230.0,Mendoza Province
59556,South Africa,"Named after Danie de Wet's wife, this elegant Chardonnay balances smooth fruit with crisp acidity and a spice-and-toast finish.

Complex, unique and quite appealing.",91,45.0,Washington

59569,France,"This interesting rosé actually resembles a thirst-quenching Sauvignon Blanc in its pungent, passion-fruit aromas. It's even slightly sweaty, like some SBs (and it is a pale-hued rosé).

59574,US,"Blended with 10% Syrah, this is a voluptuous, rich wine, dry and full-bodied. It has blackberry, blueberry, chocolate, bacon and sweet oak flavors. Clearly the winery's best, albeit most expensive Cabernet ever, it's gorgeous to drink now.",90,37.0,California
59575,US,"Long a producer of high quality and good value, Navarro seems to be raising the bar higher on its Pinot Noir.

59577,France,"Lascombes seems to have got into its stride even in a difficult vintage such as this. Ripe black-berry fruits are there along with firm, balanced wood and spice flavors that give promise of some aging.

59583,US,"A fine Otis Cab, from Columbia's now departed winemaking team of David Lake and Robert Takahashi. It's rich and deep, scented with a luscious mix of fresh herbs. The fruit has a pleasing spiciness, sweet plum and cassis threaded with anise and sage. There seems to be more fruit concentration and less of the green, peppery character that Otis can bring in some vintages, but even now this is a very young wine (it was released in June of 2008) that should reward another few years of cellaring.",91,28.0,Washington
59584,US,"This is the winery's priciest red and also its best. It immediately appeals for the soft, lush texture and the way the sweet fruit marries with the oak to wow the palate.

59601,Chile,"A wiry, green bouquet greets you along with aromas of plum, tobacco and alfalfa. The mouthfeel on this Syrah is tannic, acidic and tight, while herbal berry, cherry and cassis flavors end in a tannic, abrasive finish. This means well but it's rough and green along the way.",86,15.0,Maule Valley
59602,US,"Not quite as bold as its name suggests, this wine is well-balanced and fun to sip. Fruity and medium-bodied, it smells like raspberries and rhubarb, tastes like red cherries and feels nicely full on the palate, bolstered by a hearty dose of fine tannins.",86,12.0,California
59603,France,"A pale salmon colored rosé, this medium- to full-bodied wine offers scents of honeydew, red berries, peach and crushed stones and flavors to match.

59619,Spain,"This wine smells baked and rasiny, and the bouquet brings charcoal and toast notes into play. It feels mature and ready, with raisin, molasses, chocolate and rooty berry flavors. Ripe and ready on the finish. The blend is Garnacha, Carignan and Cabernet Sauvignon. Drink now.",87,45.0,Northern Spain

59622,US,"Occasio continues to build its case for being a winery to watch out of the Livermore Valley, releasing this lively, raspberry and honeycomb rosé made from Pinot Noir grapes out of its Del Arroyo Vineyard. The Pommard clone fruit was cold soaked in stainless steel, then pressed from the skins and racked again into stainless steel. A rosé with some meat on its bones, it's way more than an aperitif and will stand strongly aside a full range of summer foods.",88,22.0,California
59623,US,"From the lightly nutty almond-skin aroma, to the creamy palate and savory finish, it's apparent that the winemaker enjoys experimenting with lees contact to help broaden the midpalate.

59624,Italy,"Aromas of oak, espresso, earth and leather characterize this blend of 95% Sangiovese and 5% Cabernet Sauvignon. The palate shows toasted oak, black pepper and black cherry notes but the fruit is starting to fade. Drink soon.",87,26.0,Tuscany
59625,Austria,"Right now, this feels like a compact parcel of closely packed fruit flavors, held tight by citric freshness and yet it offering glimpses of what is to come: there is a hint of yeasty savor, but also a textural element reminiscent of apple peel. The citrus notions are promises of tart grapefruit, tangy orange, ripe tangerine and the purest lemon. There is something definite and astute that stands with an absolutely straight backbone, just waiting for its time to arrive. It will be spectacular. Drink from 2019.",96,64.0,Kamptal
59626,US,"A solid effort from a dependable winery that used to be known for value, back before wine—especially Cabernet—prices exploded. It hits all the right notes, with black-currant aromas and flavors, herbal or bell-pepper notes and a fancy streak of mint, complexed with lots of new French oak. Dry and rich, it finishes with dusty tannins, suggesting aging possibilities. Best after 2003.",88,35.0,California
59627,US,"An exceptionally priced Sauvignon Blanc from estate-grown fruit, Brutocao's Feliz Vineyard offers pronounced aromatics, all honeysuckle and apricot.

59628,Chile,"This, like the winery's other wines from this remote northern region, carries a soupy, stewy, leathery set of aromas. In the mouth, the acidity level is high. Rustic, earthy flavors of beef stew, leafy berry fruits and marinara sauce finish blunt, oaky and herbal.",88,25.0,Elqui Valley

59633,France,"Warm and ripe, this is a beautifully balanced wine. It is packed with black-currant fruits that are bursting out of the glass. A darker side comes with the tannins and new wood flavors that are still prominent. It looks likely the wine will develop slowly, so don't drink before 2025.",94,115.0,Bordeaux
59634,US,"Predominantly Merlot, this Bordeaux-style blend includes 16% Cabernet Sauvignon, 16% Cab Franc and 11% Malbec.

59641,US,"Dense with flavors of blueberry and cassis, it's been soaked in delicious French oak barrels (60% new) for 30 months, and then given further bottle age before being released.

59642,US,"A majority of Grenache and tiny bit of Mourvèdre from Kick Ranch and McGah Vineyard were racked to concrete egg for fermentation, with the intent of preserving freshness.

59643,Chile,"This is a new wine from the Lurton brothers, and it's got good weight, color and integrity. It also shows a lot of hickory and pickle from the oak and some wayward vanilla on the juicy, jumpy palate. Not a refined wine but pretty good for size and zip.",86,14.0,Central Valley
59644,US,"A sure-fire crowd-pleaser, this tightly-wound Merlot comes on very Cab-like, but with red fruits more than blue or black.

Dense, textural and smoky, it's delicious now or could be cellared for another five or six years.",92,25.0,Washington

59646,US,"Smoky, herbal aromas, a tannic mouthfeel and austere flavors like unsweetened cranberries characterize this deliberately taut wine. It might soften with time, but it's tough to discern if the fruit character can sustain long-term aging.",86,42.0,California
59647,US,"There are multiple Freedom Hill selections in this winery's 2015 lineup, but the Pommard clone bottling expresses more of the site's brambly wildness along with its lusciously fruity raspberry flavors. Texture and length elevates it above much of the competition.",93,48.0,Oregon
59648,US,"Ice wines are a rarity in Washington. This one offers aromas of orange peel, flowers and candied ginger, seeming to show a touch of oxygen exposure. It's sweet (155g/L residual sugar) but is still quite deft in style.",88,55.0,Washington

59650,US,"While the aromas of white strawberry, passion fruit preserves and citrus are soft spoken, they increase in intensity on the palate.

59660,Germany,"Intense smoke and crushed-stone notes linger from start to finish on this distinctly mineral beerenauslese, adding a savory tone to luscious honey and lemon flavors.

59662,Chile,"Everything about this mass-market Chard works. The nose has some pleasant nectarine and apricot aromas, while the mouth is racy and lively, and loaded with mango, pear and honeydew flavors. The finish is fruity, if a tad sweet.

59667,France,"This is a really fragrant wine, with white hedgerow flowers that introduce its rich, full body. It has just a touch of sweetness from the ripe pear and quince flavors, although the texture also has a fine edge of minerality. Age for another 1–2 years.",91,35.0,Alsace

59670,US,"Tastes like the grapes really struggled to get ripe in this chilly vintage.

59727,US,"A pretty salmon-pink in color, and a lovable quaffer, this wine is dry, crisp and brightly refreshing in succulent waves of grapefruit and tangerine, remarkably light in alcohol but not shy in flavor. Enjoy it on its own or with a range of foods—its lightness begets versatility.",91,22.0,California
59728,US,"A massively constructed Chardonnay that's opulent and concentrated and bursts in the mouth with pineapple, lemon drop candy, Asian pear and white peach flavors of enormous ripeness. The entire production of 108 cases was aged in new oak, so there's a lavish veneer of sweet, smoky buttered toast. Sur lie aging is evident in the creaminess and ever so slight sourdough tartness that adds a piquant touch. This impressive Chard is at its best now in its flashy, flamboyant youth.",95,100.0,California
59729,Germany,"Subtle minerality lends finesse to pristine notes of lime, kiwi and grapefruit in this thirst quenching off-dry Riesling. It's pleasantly honeyed yet brisk, suggesting excellent pairings with spicier Chinese or Thai dishes. Drink now through 2020.",88,14.0,Rheinhessen

59731,US,"Quite as good as the excellent '07, maybe even better, as it shows a little more structure behind the raspberry and cherry flavors. Tastes really good, a silky, spicy and dry wine that's a pleasure to drink. What a shame how little Pinot is actually grown in the Santa Cruz Mountains.",93,39.0,California
59732,Argentina,"Smells candied and gummy, with sweet, stewy red-berry aromas along with carob. The palate is fairly full and tannic, with cooked, herbal berry flavors that carry over onto the finish, which folds in coffee and grabby tannins. Good enough but sort of stewed and candied.",84,14.0,Mendoza Province
59733,US,"A very good Opus with plenty of forward cherries and black raspberries as well as rich notes of spiced oak that give a nougat or crunchy vanilla granola sweetness to the finish. The vintage was not Opus One's best, but the wine is impeccably crafted, and shows its usual fine tannic structure.",90,195.0,California

59735,New Zealand,"Eradus continues a successful run with this year's Sauvignon Blanc. As usual, it's fairly pungent and herbal upfront, but then delivers waves of passion fruit. It's concentrated and fairly full-bodied for a Sauvignon, with a lingering finish.",91,20.0,Marlborough
59736,US,"Sourced entirely from the Rose Rock Vineyard in Oregon's Eola-Amity Hills, this is fresh and carries plenty of strawberry fruit alongside cola and a whiff of smoke. The mouthfeel is textural, light and layered, with a pretty, medium-long finish.",90,49.0,Oregon
59737,Italy,"This full-bodied red opens with aromas of mature plum, hay, underbrush and scorched earth.

Enjoy through 2019.",90,60.0,Tuscany

59740,US,"Nine vineyards spread throughout eastern Washington contribute to this tart, earthy and dark-toned Cabernet. The alcohol reaches almost 14%, and in this vintage the acids are quite pronounced. Firm, focused cassis and black cherry fruit is framed in polished tannins. Grill a steak and slice some cheese and you are ready to roll with this one.",90,20.0,Washington
59741,Italy,"This vintage of Tenuta di Trinoro's renowned super Tuscan (mostly Merlot with some Cab Franc, Petit Verdot and Canernet Sauvignon) is a tad too ripe and mature to score higher. Bold notes of strawberry and blackberry preserves rob the wine of some of its inherent elegance and add a chewy, sticky element to its mouthfeel. Otherwise, you'll get bold tones of tobacco, leather and spice.",89,120.0,Tuscany
59742,France,"Rich as well as structured, it's ripe and already delicious. Berry and cherry fruits are nicely surrounded by both acidity and tannins. Full in the mouth, it's going to be an estimable wine. Drink from 2017.",90,30.0,Burgundy

59745,Italy,"Camelot is a bold blend of Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot that shows great balance and elegant composure. It's not overdone or jammy, despite the hot climate that shaped it. Instead, it shows focus and precision in its blackberry, cherry, oak spice and cinnamon notes.",90,47.0,Sicily & Sardinia
59746,Chile,Crisp aromas veer towards fresh bell pepper and tangerine peel. This feels minerally but also like extracted grape skins. Mixed citrus and green-herb flavors end with a stony lasting feel.,87,17.0,Leyda Valley
59747,Germany,"A rich layer of caramelized honey penetrates through bristling limes, lemons and tangerines in this sprightly medium-sweet Riesling. It's light as a feather yet pulsating with sweet yellow peach and apricot flavors. Vibrantly acidic but nuanced and substantial, it drinks gorgeously now but has enough substance to age well through at least 2025.",94,34.0,Mosel
59748,US,"The distinctive nose on this wine shows charred beef, concentrated cola, sweet blackberry jelly, black olive and chopped weeds, the last element reminiscent of a day spent gardening. The flavors are sanguine with bloody meats, showing a touch of dark red cranberry fruit and pepper on finish.",87,33.0,California

59751,US,"Marked by rich acids and tannins, this is a youthful Pinot that needs brief time in the cellar, or decanting, to let it soften and mellow. The tightness doesn't prevent the massive cherry, black raspberry, vanilla, cola and Asian spice flavors from shining through.

59754,Italy,"A blend of Sangiovese, Merlot and Syrah, this has fruity aromas of dark-skinned berry along with a whiff of all spice. The fresh easygoing palate shows blackberry, black cherry and a hint of ground pepper accompanied by soft tannins. Enjoy soon.",87,17.0,Tuscany

59756,Italy,"A 50-50 blend of Sangiovese and Malvasia Nera, Maurleo shows a fresh, crisp quality with red cherry and wild berries in the foreground. Dig deeper and you'll find spice, toast and nutty tones as well.",88,18.0,Tuscany
59757,US,"This wine offers lively citrus and moderate acidity—a simple dry expression of the variety that refreshes. Stainless-steel fermented, it's been aged in both stainless and neutral Burgundy oak, adding complexity around the seasonings of lemongrass and ginger.",87,30.0,California

59760,Italy,"Made from Negroamaro, this coppery, peach-hued rosé is rather weighty, with flavors that run toward cherries and chocolate. You could serve it with rich seafood dishes, but it can also stand up to grilled beef.",87,15.0,Southern Italy
59761,France,"Rounded red apple with an edge of peppery spice and a whole lot of grapefruit zest makes for a lively, textured and vivid palate. This is fresh, pure and totally appetizing. The finish similarly leaves the impression of peppery red apples.",90,22.0,Alsace

59766,US,"Shows the opulent fruit of the vintage, when long hangtime made ripeness so easy to achieve. The jammy raspberry and cherry flavors are spicy, with a sweet, smoky coating of oak. Brisk acidity and a savory minerality lift the fruit into complexity. Should age well, so drink through 2016 or so.",92,49.0,California
59767,France,"Powerful, with tannins that are seamlessly woven into the fruitiness, this is a rounded, ripe and concentrated wine. The berry fruits and the juicy damsons are as important as the generous, soft texture. The wine will develop over the medium-term; drink from 2017.",92,180.0,Burgundy
59768,US,"This is a very dry, acidic wine. It's rather austere, not showing much richness now. With a minerally tang, It's more like a French Chablis than an opulent California Chardonnay. Give it credit for elegance and finesse.",91,60.0,California

59771,US,"Voluptuously full-bodied and smoky, this 100% varietal wine imparts characteristics of cedar, herb and cigar on its grippy and generous palate. This is a reserve-level wine that delivers on that promise, it finishes awash in fists of black pepper.",91,45.0,California
59772,France,"93-95 Barrel sample. A solid, almost chunky wine, but well balanced, the tannins fine and tight. The overall effect is of a wine that is warm and ripe, but there is also a tension there.",94,,Bordeaux

59774,US,"This is a reserve-style bottling based on barrel selections of the winery's extensive portfolio.

With brisk acidity, it's a rich wine that should be enjoyed now.",93,59.0,California
59775,US,"Big but balanced, this wine starts with very ripe fruit aromas, then brings bold black cherry, clove and blackberry flavors on a firm texture of fine-grained tannins and good acidity. The full body, layered fruit and dark spice elements make a great combination.",92,69.0,California
59776,US,"Perfumed lemon blossom is at the heart of this wine's bouquet, wrapped around a full body of lemony oak and savory herb. Complex, it's built on a core of girth and structure, but never becomes overly heavy on the palate, finishing with plenty of minerality.",90,24.0,California
59777,Chile,"One of Chile's go-to producers of Sauvignon Blanc has bottled a winner. This deals classic aromas of citrus, nettle and sea brine. The palate is slightly oily and creamy, but lively with acidity. Flavors of persimmon, melon and ocean brine finish slightly salty, with a fresh-meets-oily feel.",91,20.0,Casablanca Valley
59778,US,"Excessive tartness is the chief fault of this wine. The tannins are faultlessly beautiful, and the flavors, of crushed summer blackberries, teriaki beef, green tea and black pepper, are complex. But that cut of acidity is severe.",85,25.0,California
59779,US,"Made from the best four barrels of the vintage, this bottling shows an intriguing nose of soy and hoisin sauce, fresh-pressed blackberries, star anise and sandalwood. A similarly Asian-spiced character shows on the delicious palate, where nutmeg and clove meet with more blackberry fruit, black pepper, crushed herbs and a touch of caramel.",93,96.0,California
59780,US,"This wine has vibrant aromas of lemon, lime and wet stone, with a hint of lightly buttered popcorn. Flavors of pineapple, lemon and yellow apple unfold on the palate, hit by a dusting of oaky spice. The crisp texture boasts a subtle viscosity, leading into a butterscotch-accented finish.",85,25.0,Virginia
59781,US,"Fruit fans will exult in this jammy Pinot Noir. It floods the mouth with raspberries, cherries and cola, with an elaborate coating of sweet, smoky sandalwood. The richness is balanced with fine acidity. Best now and over the next year or so.",87,38.0,California
59782,France,"This wine brings out the structure inherent in this vineyard.

It's a deeply structured wine that needs to age. Drink from 2018.",96,73.0,Burgundy

59784,US,"A great value Cabernet that's earthy and direct, this has just enough flavors of red and black cherry and tobacco, with soft tannins that keep the wine interesting through the long, slightly spicy finish.

59786,US,"Smooth, satiny, seductive and deep, this exciting debut from a new winery shows first-class fruit sourcing and winemaking.

Beautifully defined and balanced throughout, this is crafted for aging, but delicious already.",92,25.0,Washington

59788,Spain,"Floral-based aromas of violet and blueberry announce this blend of Cabernet Sauvignon and Petit Verdot that also smells of hickory and campfire. A choppy, drawn-in palate is herbal and savory, with blatant oak accenting earthy berry flavors. A roasted finish with hard tannins calls for more aging or decanting. Drink through 2023.",91,30.0,Central Spain
59789,US,"This has oodles of ripe boysenberry and huckleberry in the aroma, and the overt fruitiness continues in the flavors. A nice touch of oak sawdust in the aroma comes off more like a touch of sweetness in the flavors. There is a rich mouthfeel, soft tannins and full body. It's enjoyable and easy to drink.",89,24.0,California
59790,US,"Dark pinkish-red, this wine comes from two blocks of the producer's Carneros estate, which are harvested at lower sugar ripeness to offer a dry refreshing experience, which this wine does. This exudes weighty and broad flavors of tangy watermelon, orange and cranberry, with a satisfying grip of power on the finish.",92,30.0,California
59791,US,"Jammy fruit aromas and flavors and a lack of overt oak notes make this full-bodied wine easy to love. It's simply yummy in flavor, polished in texture, and has a nice, lingering ripe fruit finish.",89,13.0,California
59792,Italy,"This pure expression of Cabernet Sauvignon from sunny Tuscany has done a good job of holding up to the heat of the vintage. The wine shows ripe aromas of blackberry, chocolate and spice but does not taste jammy or cooked. In fact, it strikes a very good balance between fruit and firmness.",90,35.0,Tuscany
59793,Argentina,"The name and packaging scream “concept wine,” but what's in the bottle will win you over. It's full and rubbery, with pleasant yet generic berry aromas. The palate is racy and fairly hefty and tannic, with black raspberry, plum and mild herbal flavors. Grabby, with good acidity on the finish.",86,10.0,Mendoza Province
59794,Italy,"Aromas of meat juices, underbrush and black truffle take center stage along with a whisper of oak in this blend of 90% Sangiovese and 10% Merlot. The juicy palate delivers a core of ripe black cherry accented with licorice, black pepper and bell pepper notes. Solid tannins and fresh acidity round out its profile.",89,17.0,Tuscany

59796,Chile,"Big and ripe, with cola, root beer and berry aromas along with rich oak. The palate is a high-wire act of bright red fruit combined with thick milk chocolate and malt. The tannins and acidity allow the wine to be aggressive, maybe too much so given that the fruit is somewhat tart and prickly.",86,20.0,Curicó Valley
59797,France,"Minty aromas go along with firm, barely bitter tannins. They dominate the wine, smothering the fruit and lending a burnt quality to the palate.",85,22.0,Bordeaux
59798,US,"Scott Sampler's experimentation with extra long macerations seem to imbue even more of a sense of place to his wines. In this case, that translates to very purple aromas of grape Jolly Ranchers, violet oil and warm black licorice. An exotic Indian-candy spice shows on the tip of the sip, leading into rich blueberry and fresh purple-flower flavors, with coffee and cocoa on the finish.",93,75.0,California
59799,Spain,"Warm red-berry aromas are simple and fresh, a hallmark of a good Alicante wine. This is a touch sharp and drawing on the palate, with cherry, plum and berry flavors. Crisp and focused on the finish, this ranks as an ideal everyday quaffer.",87,7.0,Levante
59800,US,"This vineyard high up toward the Blue Mountains is best known for its Syrah. Aromas of garden herbs and cranberry lead to a tart, lightly grippy palate. It needs time to stretch its legs but the balance is there.",89,40.0,Washington
59801,US,"This is a light, nondescript white wine, with a trace of sweetness on the finish.",83,15.0,California
59802,France,"For the vintage, this is a rich wine. It has spice, an herbal edge and a touch of pepper. Its red fruits are superripe with a bitter bite that masks the acidity. Let this settle for a few months and drink from 2018.",88,24.0,Provence
59803,France,"Made from 30-year-old vines, this dense wine has considerable acidity that gives a fresh edge along with spice and a juicy black-currant character. It will age quickly, so drink from 2017.",87,20.0,Bordeaux

59805,US,"Fistfuls of rustic, pungent earth rise out of this silky, complex wine that is sourced from Nobles and Spring Hill vineyards.

59809,France,"Named after the stones in the vineyard, this tense, dense wine is still young. With steely acidity and a strongly mineral, chalky texture, it needs to age.

59810,US,"Aromas of char and toast are quite up front, though they smooth out over time and give way to lemon meringue.

59811,Israel,"Castel's Blanc is always a well-made selection, and the 2010 carries on that tradition. With 12 months spent in French oak, this is a rich and rounded Chardonnay that exhibits excellent balance and structure, matching bright acidity and refreshing sweet citrus flavors with lush notes of wood-grilled apple, orange creamsicle, crushed yellow flower and peach pit nuttiness. Accents of woody spice and lime zest carry onto the long finish.",91,50.0,Judean Hills

59814,US,"Full bodied, savory and retentive of tannin and oak, this is a robust, rich and ripe wine, with a tang of dark cherry, cola and vanilla. Youthful, it has ample acidity to keep it fresh in the glass, but allow it to open over time.",90,75.0,California

59816,New Zealand,"A relative bargain in the scheme of barrel-fermented Sauvignon Blanc, Kevin Judd's version boasts toasty, nutty notes upfront, followed by creamy citrus and stone-fruit aromas and flavors.

59820,US,"The reserve bottling shows more phenolic bite than the easy-drinking regular release.

This is the one to tuck away for a couple more years while drinking the regular Willamette Valley bottling.",91,50.0,Oregon
59821,US,"Great structure, with crisp, supportive acids and a fine overlay of oak that seasons but doesn't overwhelm. The flavors are quite lean. The winemaker calls them mineral-like, but it's more like grapefruits and lemons. The main problem with this well-made wine is, in fact, this lack of flavor.",84,23.0,California
59822,US,"There's a rugged earthiness and delicious meaty character to this fantastic bottling, which shows dried cranberries, dried olallieberry, smoked pork and hummingbird sage on the brawny nose.

59825,France,"From 70-year-old vines, this cedar-tinged wine reflects its maturation in one-third new oak. Brown sugar, cracked pepper and plum notes mingle easily into a pleasant, silky Cornas that should have broad appeal. Drink now–2025.",91,120.0,Rhône Valley
59826,US,"This Gallo brand exploits extensive new Pinot plantings in the appellation to produce a wine that's clean and correct, rather than exciting. The flavors range from cranberries to black cherries, and the tannins are silky. Will improve with a year or so in the cellar.",87,24.0,California

59829,US,"This is marked by hard tannins and acidity, bearing blackberry, dark chocolate and mineral flavors, with a smoky oak note that is unintegrated with the other components. Will it age?

59830,US,"This is sourced from the winery's steepest and most wind-exposed blocks in their estate vineyard.

59835,US,"It's hard to fall immediately in love with this Cabernet, despite the fancy Oakville address, as the tannins are so firm. But it's dry and clean, and although the tannins are the star—bold and astringent—there's black fruit there, too, to help it along. Drink now.",85,19.0,California
59836,US,"Stunning, dramatic, but nowhere near ready to drink.

59856,US,"This is tough in tannins and somewhat rustic now, in the way of young Monte Bellos. There's not much to recommend opening it anytime soon, especially if you're a fan of the modern style of accessible lusciousness. But it is rich and minerally, with a fine core of black fruit. Monte Bello Estate (not to be confused with Ridge's similarly-named Estate Monte Bello, which costs far less) is a wine that historically ages very well, and 2009 was a pretty good vintage, so you're safe cellaring it for at least 10 years.",92,150.0,California

59871,US,"Picked and vinified expressly for this rosé, the grapes were sourced from the Armada Vineyard. It has a pale, copper-like onion-skin shade, it is aged for a year longer than most rosés, but it has lost none of its freshness.

59875,US,"Some tasters will really love this Walla Walla Valley Syrah for its massive flavors of liquorous coffee and vanilla. A cookie dough baking spice flavor abounds, but at the moment, the fruit seems hidden. Perhaps it just needs more bottle age to balance itself out—time will tell.",89,53.0,Washington

Vintages aren't always kind to this mountain fruit, but in 2009, the conditions were just right to produce a wine of immaculate structure.

The acid-tannin balance is spot-on.",90,63.0,Oregon

59896,France,"Made with 25% Mourvèdre, this blend benefits from that grape's intense perfume and structure.

59899,Argentina,"A little heavy and teetering toward overripeness, but it holds the line despite issuing aromas of raisin, heat, leather and marinated meat.

59943,Italy,"This opens with aromas of toast, pressed violet, mint and woodland berry. On the palate, notes of dried Mediterranean herb and mocha accent a core of dried black cherry. Polished tannins lend it an easy-drinking quality so enjoy sooner rather than later.",88,16.0,Tuscany
59944,US,"The inaugural release of this wine, this hails largely from the esteemed Klipsun Vineyard. Alluring aromas of herb, earth, cherry liqueur and black fruit lead to sweet, sappy black-fruit flavors and burly but still well-integrated tannins. It's only going to get better with additional time in the bottle. Best after 2023.",92,75.0,Washington
59945,US,"A deep sniff delivers leather, ripe black cherry, marzipan and some smokiness, but the palate isn't congruent. It's candied, a bit burnt, and it tastes just a tad too much like cherry cough syrup. The texture is fine and the flavors solid, but it falls short in the areas of layering and elegance. It's too one-dimensional and not multifaceted. –M.S.",86,35.0,Oregon
59946,US,"This is one of the most successful Pinots the winery has produced, and I have no doubt it's because the vintage was so cool. The wine is absolutely dry and has bracing acidity, with extraordinarily long, deep flavors of grapes that achieved maximum ripeness but remain balanced.

59950,Chile,"Herbaceous aromas of black olive, tree bark and pickle brine lead to a chunky, grabby palate.

59952,US,"Sweet-leaning red berries meet with touches of cinnamon and vanilla on the nose of this affordably priced wine.

59954,US,"This is just the third Sauvignon Blanc from Stevens (none was made in 2008), sourced from Klipsun vineyard and stainless steel fermented. Richly textural, with a creamy minerality, this has a pleasing intensity, a sort of nervosity (as the French might put it), lined with a sweet grain character. The fruits are tart and racy, a mix of citrus rind and pulp, tangerine and pineapple, finished with natural acidity.",91,19.0,Washington
59955,US,"Minty blackberry fruits mix with black loam and fudge on the nose of this wine from a winery in West Paso along Vineyard Drive.

59957,US,"The important thing to know about this Riesling is that it's frankly sweet, with sugary apricot, orange, green apple and honeysuckle flavors. It's also brilliantly clean and vibrant in acidity. If you like this off-dry style, it's definitely for you.",86,20.0,California

59962,US,"This blend of 50% Nebbiolo, 25% Barbera and 25% Syrah offers aromas of fudge, blackberry and plum that are somehow both lean and rich. It's thick and full on the palate, with pepper spice, leather, tobacco and violets, yet the acidity is quite powerful. Serve with hearty pasta.",87,65.0,California
59963,Spain,"Generally speaking, this a neutral wine that makes no impression. It shows pine and generic citrus on the nose, followed by equally generic apple and orange flavors. Waxy and drying on the finish, with limited scope and depth. Drink right away, if at all.",83,12.0,Central Spain
59964,US,"The Bennett Valley-based producer employed fruit from its neighborhood for this wine, filling it out with a majority of grapes from Alexander Valley.

On the finish, expect vanilla bean and fresh lemon.",90,26.0,California
59965,France,"A light, floating style, pierced with minerality and crisp green apple skin flavors. There is wood, but it is only just noticeable. With its structure and tense fruit, this is likely to age well: give it 5–8 years.",90,65.0,Burgundy

59970,US,"This is one of the most forward and accessible of Calera's new releases. It's superrich now in black cherry liqueur, mocha, licorice, bacon and spice flavors, a seductively silky wine that's a total hedonistic pleasure. If you can keep from drinking it now, it should develop well over the next 6–8 years.",93,40.0,California

It shows the thrilling balance of the vineyard, with ripe fruit in tension with minerals, brisk acidity and wonderful mountain tannins.

59979,Israel,"Inky red-violet in the glass, this wine has aromas of black cherry and chocolate.

59982,France,"A toasty and buttery wine that is initially smooth and silky. It's only on the mid-palate that the tauter, more steely character of Chablis comes through. With fresh acidity, this easily combines both ripeness and mouthwatering crispness.",91,36.0,Burgundy
59983,US,"Barely ripe, with a pungent, ammonia edge to the citrus fruits. It's very dry and crisp in acidity.",82,12.0,California

59985,US,"Austere and elegant in its cool-climate, light-bodied way, this wine is dark and brooding nonetheless, offering a wild bramble of berry and rhubarb flavors. Firm in tannin and subtle in oak, it is dotted in black-tea and savory forest-floor edges.",92,55.0,California
59986,Spain,"Scratchy red-fruit aromas are a bit raw and chemical. This is grabby and gritty in the mouth, with flavors of plum, berry, green herbs and oaky carob. A woody, tannic, lightly herbal and green finish feels drawing and snappy. This is mostly Carignan with lesser amounts of Garnacha and Syrah.",88,49.0,Catalonia

59992,US,"The chilly vintage shows in the light delicacy of this Pinot Noir. It's pale in color and quite tart in the mouth, which gives the cherries, cranberries and cola a bite. There's a rich jacket of oak, while the official alcohol level is 14.2% by volume. Drink now–2016.",90,55.0,California
59993,France,"The minerality of this pure Chardonnay shows how close the Côte des Bar is to the vineyards of Chablis. It has a chalky texture as well as ripeness, a crisp and structured wine. This bottling is a little young and will repay waiting few months, so drink from late 2017.",91,100.0,Champagne
59994,US,"A tremendous wine that shows how Merryvale is absolutely at the top of its game. Impeccable in structure, with refined tannins that are soft and firm at the same time, and a fine cut of acidity. Entirely dry, the Cabernet Sauvignon-based blend is awesome in blackberry, cherry, cassis and oak flavors, with complexities of anise, soy sauce, grilled meats and minerals. Beyond the particulars, it just feels dramatic and rich in the mouth. A great wine that should develop in the bottle over the next decade.",97,165.0,California
59995,France,"Dark chocolate and black currant flavors dominate this concentrated wine. It is densely tannic, while still allowing room for the brooding fruit to show through. Still young, it will age slowly and impressively over the next five years.",93,27.0,Southwest France
59996,US,"La Casita is all clone 114 and 50% whole-cluster fermented. In a year with many wines showing minimal ripeness, this breaks the mold. The forward strawberry fruit hints at sugary sweetness. Flavors are fresh and appealing, front-loaded and best for near-term consumption.",89,50.0,Oregon

59998,US,"Fermented with roughly one-third whole clusters, this wine brings a juicy mix of blackberry and black-cherry fruit front and center, with the AVA's wet-stone minerality underneath.

60012,US,"This 100% Cabernet, from the iconic Klipsun vineyard, has been sourced from the original 1989 planting since the first crop, making Seven Hills Klipsun's longest standing customer. This offers deep cassis, mineral, and earth flavors, powerful and dense. The Seven Hills style, ordinarily restrained and elegant, suits this vineyard especially well, as it reins in the tendency of Klipsun fruit to go over the top, and become too tannic. This is muscular and deep, but proportionate and detailed.",93,32.0,Washington
60013,Australia,"Yering Station makes a regular Chardonnay and a Reserve Chardonnay as well; this is its entry-level Chard, and quite a good one.

60020,US,"Duckhorn's Three Palms bottling is one of the oldest and most consistent Merlot vineyard designations in California and this is a classic example. The wine always is very tannic. But the '05 is dry and rich and complex in mineral-laden cherries and currants, with just the right application of new oak. You can decant it now for several hours and enjoy with a dramatically charred steak, but it will develop beautifully through 2011, at least.",94,85.0,California

60032,US,"The tannins are very hard on this bone-dry Cabernet Sauvignon, which was blended with 5% Cabernet Franc.

60039,US,"This 100% estate-grown Merlot opens with meaty aromas of plum and black cherry. There is a pleasant, roasted character to the flavors, with nutmeg and cinnamon spice.

60053,US,"Oak plays a prominent role in this Chard, giving it a wealth of sweet vanilla custard, butterscotch, toast and caramelized aromas and flavors. Under that coat is a ripe wine packed with pineapples and Meyer lemons. Drink this flamboyant wine now.",90,38.0,California

60056,US,"In 2014 this vineyard designate was further subdivided by clone. The Pommard bottling pushes big fruit front and center—a juicy mix of blood orange, red berries and cherries. There's a certain stiffness to the tannins still, but overall it's finely proportioned and should be enjoyable through the mid-2020s.",91,65.0,Oregon
60057,Spain,"Pink meets orange in terms of hue, while the nose gives a nice blend of sweet and snappy berry and citrus. The palate has a little weight and heft along with dry, white-peppery flavors of nectarine and apricot. Pithy, citrusy and healthy throughout. Good wine for the money.",87,7.0,Central Spain

60061,US,"A top-of-the-line effort and a departure from the producer's single-vineyard, 100% varietal bottlings, this blends 4% Malbec and 3% Merlot. Spicy with clove scents, it showcases deep cassis and cranberry flavors, with a lift of red fruit and supportive acidity.",93,175.0,California

60066,US,"Encased in a lightweight, eco-friendly AstraPouch, this easy-to-share Cabernet is full of bright, cherry-fruit flavors and clove. It's simply drinkable and a good way to go for picnics, tailgates or when you just want a small pour.",86,19.0,California
60067,France,"Anyone with a yen for the flappers of the 1920s should get this wine, with its label showing a vision of the French Riviera in that era. The wine itself is modern, clean and crisp with an attractive lightness. Ripe strawberries come through strongly in the aftertaste.",86,13.0,Provence
60068,US,"Just too raisiny and stewed for real satisfaction. The extreme dryness and shriveled fruit taste accentuates the alcohol and tannins, making the wine hot and astringent.",83,21.0,California
60069,Italy,"This wine opens with slightly rustic, leafy aromas that blow off in the glass to reveal mature black fruit and spice. The soft palate offers up ripe black cherry, blackberry and cinnamon. It's round and ready so enjoy soon.",89,35.0,Tuscany
60070,US,"Wy'east is better than ever in this vintage, a divine balancing act with berry, plum, Asian spices and chocolate all in focus.

60073,US,"There is something ethereal and beyond words about this wine, a full-bodied but never intrusive expression of spicy cinnamon, black pepper and wild pine that makes it a puzzle worth trying to solve.

60075,New Zealand,"This is slightly bigger and earthier than Ara's other 2009 Pinot Noir, with notes more of beet than cherry, and hints of dried herbs and mushrooms. It's a sturdy wine that could stand up to braised meats.",86,15.0,Marlborough
60076,Italy,"This super Tuscan blend of Syrah and Merlot opens with lush berry notes and clean aromas of cherry, blackberry and soft Christmas spice. The wine tastes rich, satisfying and would make a great match to lamb chops with roasted garlic potatoes.",88,31.0,Tuscany

60081,Germany,"From an old clone yielding smaller berries and having a longer hang time, this is even more minerally than Müller's regular Kirchenstück spätlese, showing a briny aspect to the minerality and bringing in more intensity, including passion fruit and a sweetness reminiscent of roasted root vegetables. Ends on lingering notes of honey and lime.",91,41.0,Pfalz

60083,Italy,"Packaged in a handsome bottle with an embossed viper on the front, this blend of Merlot, Sangiovese (with a small percentage of Montepulciano for extra power and intensity) offers easy sensations of ripe fruit and exotic spice. The low price makes it even more attractive.",87,13.0,Central Italy

60090,France,"Ripe and showing the typical generosity of this château, this bold, round wine is powered by rich berry and damson fruit flavors. It is juicy and perfumed, while the tannic structure and wood flavors are enveloped by the fruits. Drink from 2020.",94,,Bordeaux

60092,US,"Made from 100% Syrah, this dry, succulent wine is copper-colored and bursting in watermelon, cranberry and bristling acidity.

60093,France,"This wine is coming into balance with wood, acidity and fruit all present. It has a dusty tannic character that's attractive and acts as a good base for the blackberry flavors. The wine will develop quickly, so drink from 2018. Laurent and Sophie Cisneros bought Rouillac with a focus: eliminate chemical pesticides and herbicides. They built a barrel cellar to environmental European standards. The vineyard is 60 acres Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot, with five acres of white grapes. Eric Boissenot consults.",90,,Bordeaux
60094,France,"Juicy acidity cuts through this firmly structured, mineral wine. Great swathes of fresh citrus and ripe apricots go with the toastiness and dense texture. This is a very terroir-driven wine with a long future. Drink from 2018.",93,159.0,Burgundy
60095,US,"With very slight oak, but aged on the lees, this Sauvignon Blanc has richness that outshines the underlying fruit, which suggests lemons and limes. The wine was not put through the malolactic fermentation, so acidity is brisk. Good job for a fancy wine at a decent price.",88,18.0,California
60096,US,"You may or may not fancy the blue bottle, but the juice inside is a good example of Yakima Valley Riesling. Tea, honey and lemon flavors are co-mingled; and the 5% residual sugar adds sweetness without becoming grainy or cloying.",87,9.0,Washington
60097,US,"Vibrant, fruity and dry now, with savory black currant, red currant, plum and cherry flavors, this Cab also has a spicy, minty quality that makes it come alive on the palate. It's young and tannic, and will benefit from up to eight years in the cellar.",90,59.0,California
60098,Chile,"Rubbery berry and cassis aromas show modest complexity as they air out and become more spicy. This feels good and bold, with lifting acidity. Flavors of ripe berry and cassis finish with molasses, chocolate and lasting berry flavors along with a blast of heat.",89,19.0,Maipo Valley
60099,US,"Powerful vanilla scents rise from the glass, but the fruit, even in this difficult vintage, comes out immediately. It's tart and sharp, with a strong herbal component, and the wine snaps into focus quickly with fruit, acid, tannin, herb and vanilla in equal proportion. Firm and tight, still quite young, this wine needs decanting and/or further bottle age to show its best.",91,45.0,Oregon
60100,Germany,"Exotic spice notes accent ripe yellow-peach and apricot aromas on the nose of this briskly composed, dry Riesling. The palate is intensely mineral, with layers of wet stones and crushed earth that lend a savoriness to delicate fruit and floral flavors. Finishes long, with a note of lime zest.",90,50.0,Rheingau
60101,US,"From the proprietor's 30 acres of the variety, planted to three clones ideally suited for the coolness of the site, this is a relatively light-bodied wine. However it presents a richness and concentration of pineapple and green olive, the oak providing a baked, creamy sensation.",90,35.0,California
60102,US,"Now eight years old, this Pinot Noir shines. Its aromas range from concentrated plum, earthy beet and rhubarb to balsamic vinegar and mint chip ice cream.

60104,New Zealand,"Made from certified organic fruit, this impressively dark and tannic bottling is essentially the second wine of Huia. Dark cherries and vanilla finish firm. Drink it now with grilled meats, or hold it until 2018–2019 and see how it develops in the cellar.",86,20.0,Marlborough
60105,Argentina,"This is a rough, leathery and stalky Cabernet. Horseradish and leather aromas set up a lightly green, herbal and peppery flavor profile. While the wine feels pretty good, there's no escaping its green-leaning, stalky character.",84,34.0,Mendoza Province
60106,Spain,"Initial aromas of wet cement, black cherry and cassis grow more rubbery, reduced and animal-driven the longer this Syrah sits around. Bright, fresh and fiercely tannic, this deals dark-berry flavors, peppery spice and raw oak on top of dry, herbal notes. Oaky but not overly charred or pushy on the finish.",87,24.0,Catalonia
60107,France,"Showing the typical power and concentration of the 2010 vintage, this is a dense and structured wine. Good acidity and black plum flavors show through the big tannic texture and dry core. The wine still needs to age so drink from 2018. This is a 60% Merlot, 30% Cabernet Sauvignon, 10% Cabernet Franc blend from Mallet Frères.",88,25.0,Bordeaux
60108,France,"On the light side, this is an attractive wine, but missing the intensity of some other wines from Saint-Julien. It's balanced, fresh and elegant.",89,,Bordeaux
60109,New Zealand,"A bit disappointing from veteran winemaker Alan McCorkindale, or maybe this is just sliding past its prime. The modest grapefruit notes, herbal overtones and tart finish are fine, but fail to excite. Drink up.",85,19.0,Marlborough
60110,US,"A rather ordinary Merlot, dry and rugged, with jammy-fruity flavors of cherries, herbs and oak. Blended with Beckstoffer Cabernet Sauvignon, which gives it needed body and power.",86,29.0,California
60111,US,"There's a nice dollop of warm butter on the nose of this bottling from a vineyard planted in 1975, but it's well restrained and enhanced by vanilla yogurt and graphite aromas. A crushed sea-shell minerality shines on the palate, where apple flesh, graphite and lemon rinds combine for a full sipping experience.",92,25.0,California
60112,US,"Savory aromas of black pepper, dried beef, soy, tangy elderberry, fresh boysenberry and deep lavender show on the nose of this single vineyard study. The palate is very floral at first, and then flavors of black currant, vanilla, pencil lead, baking spice, tar and white pepper ride the waves of acidity.",92,50.0,California
60113,France,"Smooth and softly textured, this is an attractive red wine. It has ripe berry fruits, gentle tannins that are enough to bring out the wood and spice flavors. Give the wine two years.",87,45.0,Loire Valley
60114,Italy,"Il Groto is an easy blend of red grapes that are native to the Verona area in northern Italy. This is the kind of wine you'll want to pair with informal, home-cooked meat dishes like stew or roast beef. Aromas here include cherry, almond and a touch of sweet vanilla.",86,14.0,Veneto
60115,Italy,"A savory blend of 45% Cabernet Sauvignon, 45% Merlot and 10% Cabernet Franc, this opens with aromas of scorched earth, meat juices, leather, black fruit and spices. The dense, low-acid palate delivers black currants and fleshy black cherry accented with black pepper and mocha alongside soft, round tannins. Drink now through 2017.",90,60.0,Tuscany
60116,US,"A disappointing wine, not one of Adelaida's best. The problem isn't just excessive softness, sweetness and heat from high alcohol, it's a vegetative note that mars the blackberries and cherries.",84,35.0,California
60117,US,"Fresh apples with hints of butterscotch, toast and smoke perfume this lovely Chardonnay. While a tad short in concentration, this medium-bodied wine is wonderfully fresh and clean on the palate, with beautifully balanced oak and bright acidity on the finish.",85,15.0,New York
60118,US,"A rustic, French countryside kind of a wine, this is deliciously reflective of a cooler vintage and the nuances the variety can display in the right hands. Meat and a shaker's worth of pepper make for a savory, sauvage taste experience that's soft in texture and exotic, with a powerful bite of tannin on the finish.",93,38.0,California
60119,US,"Smells rich and decadent, with aromas of orange marmalade and honey, but still maintains refreshing touches of citrus and pineapple throughout. It's thick and rich in the mouth, and finishes long, with excellent balance. This can easily compete with Canadian ice wines.",90,32.0,New York
60120,US,"Several wineries make a Momtazi cuvée, an indication of the high esteem in which the vineyard is held. Here a touch of volatility attenuates the nose, leading into a bright, acidic young wine with flavors of orange peel, red berries, toast and nut butter.",88,55.0,Oregon
60121,France,"With the same winemaking team as Château Pichon Longueville Comtesse de Lalande in Pauillac, Bernadotte has a good pedigree. The wine is full in the mouth, structured and balanced, with ripe berry fruits bursting out from the tannic shell. The wine will develop well over the next few years; drink from 2017.",90,16.0,Bordeaux
60122,Italy,"Made with Sangiovese, Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot and Syrah, this opens with aromas of raspberry jam and underbrush along with whiffs of coffee and vanilla. The medium-bodied palate delivers mature plum, vanilla and white pepper alongside smooth tannins.",88,65.0,Tuscany
60123,US,"Swirls of butterscotch lend a rich, almost lactic feel to this sumptuously full-bodied wine. It's unabashedly oaky, boasting deep layers of spice, nut and caramel, but maintains a stately, firmly structured elegance. Bright, lemony acidity and a strike of minerality mark the finish.",90,30.0,New York
60124,US,"A bit on the dry, tannic side, this Syrah's astringency hides a rich core of blackberry and black cherry fruit. It's really too hard to enjoy now. Decant for hours, or try the cellar, although that's a gamble.",85,25.0,California
60125,US,"This ripe but fresh blend of 34% Cabernet Sauvignon, 34% Syrah and 32% Petite Sirah shows blackberry-blueberry syrup as well as cedar and smoked pork on the nose. The palate offers rich and tasty flavors of olallieberry pie cut by a graphite-driven minerality.",92,40.0,California
60126,US,"Despite the low alcohol, this is quite dry and tart, with a lemony base and some orange-pekoe flavors also. Not a complex Riesling, but light and pleasantly sippable.",87,25.0,Oregon
60127,US,Reductive oak betrays this wine's light-bodied take on the appellation. Its waxy green apple flavor and bright acidity are deftly wrapped in toastiness.,88,35.0,California
60128,Australia,"One of Yarra's first wave of modern-day wineries, Warramate was founded in 1970, which means this comes from Pinot Noir vines that can legitimately be called old. The style is resolutely traditional, with crisp acids and a wiry backbone the standout features. Cedary oak further frames tart cherry fruit, which finishes long and crisp. Drink from 2018 through until 2025.",91,,Victoria
60129,US,"The nose on this appellation blend is plump and inviting, blending pan-seared Gala apples and browned butter with a more intriguing botanical aroma. There is zip on the tip of the sip, with flavors of lime peel, lemon zest and a nuttiness in the midpalate.",89,25.0,California

60132,US,"Black as night in the glass, this heavy duty, Cabernet-led Bordeaux blend from one of the most visually stunning properties on the Central Coast is loaded with rich, luscious fruit and tannins that are built to last. There are stewed plums on the nose with warm slices of blueberry pie on the palate. Wait until at least 2019 for full enjoyment.",90,80.0,California
60133,US,"Now officially labeled from the newly named Malibu Coast appellation, this bottling shows lots of potential for the region. Aromas of lush lemonade, crushed vanilla, browned butter, honeysuckle and honey lead into a soft and lush palate that's buttery but high-toned. Flavors of toasted bread with orange marmalade prove warm but tartly dynamic.",92,39.0,California
60134,US,"Very dark and inky in color, this bottling by Matthias Pippig shows baked black plum and black cherry on the nose as well as a dusting of cocoa and elegant forest spices of juniper and pine. More baked plum and rich blueberry show on the palate, but with a considerably earthy edge of black tea, juniper, coffee and dark chocolate.",93,,California
60135,Italy,"Candied fruit, caramel, smooth vanilla cream and apricot open the opulent bouquet of this beautifully made Riserva Chardonnay. Elena Walch produces one of the best, oak-aged expressions of the grape in Italy. It closes with creamy richness and persistence.",91,37.0,Northeastern Italy

60138,US,"This crisp tightly woven white is showy in fresh-cut grass and gooseberry flavors, with an underlying grasp of grapefruit and lemon. The texture is gritty.",86,29.0,California
60139,Argentina,"Big and boisterous, as if you're sniffing a bed of coal, menthol and macerated black fruit. The palate is sun-drenched and juicy, but not what you'd call elevated. And the finish mixes savory flavors with tight tannins. A good red wine that bears little semblance to Old World Syrah.",86,11.0,Mendoza Province
60140,US,"This is a very strong showing for a brand new brand, thanks, no doubt, to veteran winemaker Jeff Fink's involvement. Tight on the nose with Meyer lemon pith, savory salts and a waft of oak smoke, the palate explodes with chalky tension and rich yet bright complexity. Flavors of white lily, peach and sea salt ride atop melted butter, leading into a caramelized finish.",94,36.0,California
60141,US,"This is a pretty wine in terms of floral aromatics, resplendent shocks of orange blossom and orange peel inviting in their exotic freshness. Lime and orange follow on the palate, which is bristling in acidity, the finish light and bright.",89,34.0,California

60145,New Zealand,"For an entry-level bottling, this is a little stern at first. Hints of char and licorice issue forth after lengthy swirling, followed by vaguely berry-like flavors and mocha notes. Finally, dark fruit and spice emerge on the finish. Worth splashing in a decanter to wake it up prior to serving.",89,29.0,Central Otago
60146,Australia,"Although d'Arenberg is better known as a source of hearty McLaren Vale red wines, this tautly balanced, wooded Chard leans toward pineapple and lime. Buttered, toasted hazelnuts add a polished, elegant note to the long, citrusy finish.",91,35.0,South Australia
60147,France,"High-toast aromas from the wood aging are followed on the palate by more layers of toast and spice.

60151,US,"Lots of rich, layered black cherry and currant fruit in this dry Cabernet, which was blended with some Cab Franc and Petite Verdot. There are also interesting notes of mushrooms beginning to emerge as the wine picks up bottle age. The finish, though, is simple despite some firm tannins, and it's hard to see the wine going anywhere, so drink up.",87,44.0,California
60152,Italy,"Morellino di Scansano is the perfect wine to pair with Italian dishes like ricotta-filled ravioli in meat sauce or fettuccine with porcini. It shows soft cherry and blackberry aromas, plus bright acids and spicy endnotes.",88,19.0,Tuscany

60168,US,"A beautiful Pinot Noir, lilting, refined and utterly delicious. Testarossa stumbled with the '04, but otherwise their track record is great, and the '06 is right up there with the marvelous '05 and '03. The wine's cherry, licorice and smoky oak flavors are captured in a rewarding texture of silk and satin.",93,54.0,California
60169,Spain,"This Catalonian blend is a concentrated number with a narrow, fruit-forward nose and cheesy leather on the side. The palate is full, grabby and ripe; flavors of blackberry and cassis are jammy and dark. It finishes sweet in flavor and ultraripe in feel, with a syrupy aftertaste. Another year or two in bottle will help this settle down; drink through 2020.",90,40.0,Catalonia
60170,South Africa,"Hay, green plum and gooseberry lead off on the nose, while ripe hints of passion fruit and pineapple acidity flood the mouth.

60171,US,"This low-production Pinot shows off the elegance and balance you expect from this famous vineyard. The wine is dry and tart in acidity, with drink-me-now cranberry, pomegranate, mushroom and new oak flavors. Decant it for an hour or two.",89,70.0,California
60172,US,"Benjamin Silver quietly makes great stuff out of a small warehouse on Santa Barbara's Eastside, including this Syrah that's boosted by pinches of Mourvèdre, Grenache and Viognier. Beautiful aromas of roasted pork in a blackberry-licorice reduction sauce pick up a bit of grape candy before hitting the palate with black pepper, blueberries and solid tannins. It's fun but serious.",92,32.0,California
60173,France,"There's an initial intense citrus character to this wine, a product of its youth. But then the freshness is enriched by the pear and green apple flavors, lifted by lively acidity. There are some almond and peach flavors to give an exotic touch to this superb wine that could age for a decade or more.",95,,Burgundy
60174,Austria,"Tentative notes of pebble and strawberry show shyly on the nose, on the palate they dominate the light body with its barely-there tannins and slender frame. This is a light-footed Pinot Noir that brings you a welcome dollop of refreshing red fruit.",86,21.0,Vienna

60176,US,"This half Cabernet, one quarter each Merlot and Cab Franc offers a lovely mix of herb and earth, moderate density, nicely spiced, with brambly red fruits. It shows delicate old vine character, making up with refined herbal flavors what it lacks in fruit sweetness.",90,50.0,Washington
60177,France,"This is part of the range of three wines from different soils. Marne, or clay and chalk soil, is relatively heavy and produces a rich style of Sauvignon Blanc.

60180,US,"The vineyard is legendary, but the brand has struggled to define itself for years. This 2010 is rich in raspberry, cherry and oak, but it is a little heavy-handed. After a brief decant, it's ready to drink now.",87,40.0,California
60181,US,"Smells simple, with vague notes of citrus fruits, but just the opposite in the mouth. Takes control of the palate with big, oaky flavors of citrus jam, wood and lots of peppery spices, and finishes rather sweet. A bit over the top.",84,25.0,California
60182,France,"With dusty white flower aromas, this is a perfumed wine with a tight texture and fruit. Still too young to drink, it does have a lively, fresh character that comes from the bright green fruits. As it softens, it will be better balanced, so drink from 2016.",88,23.0,Loire Valley
60183,US,"The deep, brooding nose blends dark purple fruit with black licorice and Chinese black pepper sauce. Sage bark and anise contribute herbal tones to the palate—likely thanks to the inclusion of 14% Merlot and 11% Cabernet Franc—and blackberries rule the fruit profile.",90,56.0,California
60184,US,"Not only is this a great bottling at a judicious price, but it also shows a great deal of nuance from the appellation that often brings mostly power. Blackberry, beef, smoked game and pencil shavings show on the nose. The palate brings bright hibiscus and tart elderberry as well as graphite, thyme and bay-leaf flavors.",93,25.0,California

60188,Spain,"This is a highly unusual blend of Marsellan and Touriga Nacional, and it smells reduced, lemony and like cola and coffee. The mouthfeel is grating, with sandpaper tannins. Odd, herbal, citrusy notes infiltrate core blueberry flavors, while the finish is hard as nails and tannic to an extreme. Only 200 cases made.",84,50.0,Levante
60189,Australia,"Starts off tighter and less giving than the regular Mort's Block, only gradually displaying its greater potential longevity. Offers crushed stone and lime notes, medium body and a clean green apple and citrus finish right now, but expect it to develop petrol, honey and toast notes within the next several years; drink now–2017.",87,35.0,South Australia
60190,US,"One of the producer's top wines, this wine is named both for Francis Ford Coppola's uncle and for the famous mathematician of ancient Greece.

60191,Chile,"Aromas of tree bark, vanilla and herbs mix with peppery red fruit scents, while the palate is comfortable and herbal, with plum and dry oak notes.

60193,France,"Ripe and fruity, this is a delicious wine. It has layers of red fruits and balanced acidity along with a gently smoky back taste. The structure is light, crisp and with the freshness that is typical of the vintage this close to Bordeaux. Drink from 2018.",87,12.0,Southwest France
60194,US,"A consummate Russian River Pinot Noir in an accessible style. This is simply enchanting, like raspberry-infused silk dusted with brown butter, cinnamon and vanilla. Showing just beautifully now, this is soft and gentle, and it should glide through the next six years.",92,40.0,California
60195,Germany,"Savory whiffs of earth and pollen belie the bounty of luscious tangerine and stone fruit flavors that await on the palate of this delicate spätlese. It's juicy and thirst quenching yet subtle, nuanced by hits of struck flint and salt. Gossamer-fine texture and bristling acidity lend tautness. It's delicious now but should gain depth and definition through 2025.",93,42.0,Mosel
60196,France,"88—90 Barrel sample. A light, fresh wine, with some good blackcurrant flavors. This offers clean, ripe fruit, soft tannins. The hint of dryness to finish is a bonus, suggesting some ageability.",89,,Bordeaux
60197,US,"This Cab is pretty thin in flavor, with some unripeness that gives it a green mintiness. However, it has a good core of blackberry flavor. Call it a rustic sipper and drink it now with simple fare.",83,12.0,California
60198,New Zealand,"This is a fairly big, muscular Pinot Noir, with beefy black-cherry fruit and oaky overtones of brown sugar. Give it a year or more to smooth out, because the long, intense finish filled with berry fruit shows tremendous promise. Drink 2013–2020.",92,50.0,Central Otago
60199,US,"A vivid bouquet of white flowers is cut by a pungent, pithy funkiness of crushed ants and iodine on this classic bottling by the Miller family and winemaker Trey Fletcher. The intriguing palate is tensely layered, with grapefruit pith, lime-sprayed limestone and a bit of almond oil on the finish, proving uniquely spicy and incredibly long-lasting.",94,45.0,California
60200,US,"The winery's most accessible and available Pinot Noir—still quite small in production—is from several vineyards, including single-vineyard sites like Jenkins. It offers classic Russian River Valley cola spice and bright aromatics and acidity, the texture soft and structured, a smaller percentage of new French oak used for aging.",91,40.0,California
60201,France,"A structured wine, packed with red fruits and delightful acidity. There is a core of dark tannin and a solid structure as well as the bright freshness at the end. Because it has this structure, it's worth aging for 4–5 years.",90,42.0,Burgundy
60202,US,"Delivers lots of bang for the buck. Shows real Chardonnay character, with rich vanilla cream-infused flavors of ripe pineapples, pears, sautéed bananas, buttered toast and honey. At this price, it's a fantastic buy that can stand next to Chards costing far more.",90,13.0,California
60203,US,"Among a fascinating array of low-alcohol Pinots from this producer, this is the standout. Bright, tart raspberry fruit, immaculately clean and refreshing, is backed with crystalline minerality. There's a touch of wet cement and a persistent, engaging finish.",93,48.0,Oregon
60204,France,"This wine is bright and fruity, with acidity and some fresh red berry fruits. The background tannins do have a dryness but will soften over the next few months. Drink from 2017. This property, east of Saint-Émilion, is run by Florent Dubard.",85,14.0,Bordeaux

60206,South Africa,"A big, exuberant nose leads on this impressive Syrah. On the palate, it's a muscular red, with balance, strength and elegant tannins. Mouthfilling but minerally enough to maintain poise, it will age well or pair now with roasted meat.",89,37.0,Stellenbosch
60207,US,"This wine from longtime Santa Cruz Mountains producer Cinnabar offers a very subtle nose with slight, brisk minerality. Once sipped, the flavors remain subtle, though are nicely rounded with a bit of guava-based tropicalitythat emerges toward the finish.",86,20.0,California
60208,US,"Just delicious. Feels soft and lush and chocolaty in the mouth, with melted blackberry and cherry flavors that taste like they were baked into a pie. The alcohol is high, in the California style, and the wine won't age, but it's fine now with a grilled steak.",90,35.0,California

60210,US,"There's a sultry aromatic combination of stewed strawberry and bright raspberry as well as subtle thyme, tarragon, rosewater and French toast on the nose of this bottling from the iconic vineyard.

As beautiful as it is now, it should slowly evolve over the next eight years.",92,42.0,California
60212,US,"Vanilla, tobacco and anise flavors quickly overwhelm the fruit; perhaps the wine just needs to breathe longer. At first taste, it quickly turns tannic and very drying; the fruit is buried and the oak flavors are still a bit jarring and disjointed.",85,15.0,Washington
60213,England,"Fragrant overtones of acacia honey play alongside lemony notes on the nose, adding a touch of restrained, exotic decadence. A hint of chalk contributes grounding dimension. All combine to make a fragrant nose. These themes play out again on the slender but expressive palate. Pure lemon freshness brightens the notions of honey and chalk, while tiny bubbles provide endless explosions of deep, sustained flavor. This wine seems still young and taut, but the energy suggests great future development. Lemon purity on the finish appeals with its clean and invigorating nature. Drink 2017–2027.",94,50.0,England
60214,France,"At this stage, the wine seems to have too much wood. Hopefully this will dissipate because round yellow fruits are all there, along with fresh, crisp acidity. It is a wine with potential and will be better from 2017.",89,49.0,Burgundy

60216,Chile,"Piercing sour raspberry aromas introduce an edgy, scratchy feeling wine with a combo of minty, herbal pie cherry and red plum flavors. This dries out and finishes modestly, but always with true Pinot Noir character.",86,17.0,Casablanca Valley
60217,US,"This is the best barrel blend from the vintage, utilizing 40% Clos Pepe, 40% Bentrock, 10% Zotovich and 10% Kessler-Haak vineyards.

60221,US,"This is a seriously good Cabernet, and the price makes it a relative bargain.

60225,Germany,"In contrast to Knyphausen's 2006 Riesling, the 2006 kabinett is restrained and minerally, offering crisp pineapple and green apple flavors underscored by mouthwatering acidity. It's slightly lighter in body as well, with a raciness that would work well served alongside sautéed trout.",86,15.0,Rheingau

The light yet grippy texture is stunning.",95,50.0,California

60230,US,"The color of this full-bodied wine is deep red and aromas are dense with dark fruit like black plum and blueberry, accented with earthy nuances. The mouthfeel is rich and almost thick, as firm but fine-textured tannins coat the tongue and concentrated flavors of dark chocolate and blueberry soak through. This should improve through at least 2020.",91,48.0,California
60231,US,"This wine is mostly Cabernet Sauvignon (81%), topped off with Malbec (10%) and Petit Verdot. Intense aromas of roasted coffee bean, char, wood spice, green herb and black fruit lead to soft supple cherry flavors, considerably more restrained than the aromas might suggest. The aromas and flavors seem a bit disconnected at present. Perhaps some time will bring them together.",88,50.0,Washington
60232,Chile,"Aromas of pink grapefruit and passion fruit are more in the Sauvignon Blanc field than your typical Chardonnay. Citric and bouncy on the palate, this tastes of tart grapefruit, orange peel and salt, and it stays that way through the finish.",83,14.0,Casablanca Valley
60233,US,"This succulent wine's brawny earth is steadied by fresh acidity, adding tart flavors of tangy rhubarb, cranberry and rose. Crushed rock and dried herb notes add savory complexity and texture, but it's the pretty aromas that ultimately seize the day.",93,55.0,California

60248,US,"As ripe as Donum's regular 2010 Russian River Pinot is, this reserve is even richer. It's certainly impressive for sheer power, but is too much of a good thing, flooding the mouth with so much soft, ripe, oaky raspberry and cherry flamboyance as to lose subtlety.",89,90.0,California

60252,US,"Named in honor of North Carolina's first commercial winery and a woman born in the 1500s in the Lost Colony of Roanoke, this white is floral in kumquat and toffee, a mix of rich and robust that's tropical in personality.

60259,Chile,"A big blanket of oaky, chocolaty, minty aromas sits on top of herbal plum and cassis scents. No surprise that this is a big wine with loud plum, blackberry and spice flavors, but it's also a bit awkward in feel.

60263,US,"More than a hint of leather has bloomed in the bottle—actually in both bottles tasted. For some tasters, that's ok; for others, it deadens the fruit flavors and the finish. In either case, best drink this up soon.",85,17.0,Washington
60264,Austria,"Lifted, notes of pure lemon zest fill the nose while the palate follows up and throws in some riper notions akin to plump, little, yellow mirabelle plums. There is a wonderfully textured midpalate that lends more body to this slender figure. The purity of the fruit expressed here is thrilling, as is the lemony freshness that pervades everything.",94,49.0,Wachau
60265,US,"This wine reflects both the challenge and some of the enjoyment of the cool 2011 vintage in Washington. Aromas of green herbs intermingle with barrel spices. It's elegantly styled with abundant vanilla, coffee and cherry flavors.",88,26.0,Washington
60266,US,"Black cherry pie, milk chocolate and lilacs combine for a very accessible and rather lavish nose on this blend of 65% Cabernet Sauvignon, 25% Cabernet Franc and 10% Merlot. It's easy to like on the sip, with candied purple fruit and licorice spice flavors, proving very fruity, lush and quaffable.",90,35.0,California
60267,France,"Not to be confused with wines from the vineyard of the same name in neighboring Pernand-Verglesses, this balanced wine shows ripe tropical fruits as well as toasted wood flavors. It is structured and still developing its rich potential. Drink from 2017.",92,44.0,Burgundy

60269,Italy,"Aromas of underbrush, leather, scorched earth and dark berry lead the nose of this firmly structured blend of Sangiovese, 10% Canaiolo and 5% Mammolo. The chewy palate offers a juicy core of black cherry accented with notes of black pepper, licorice and grilled herb. Tightly knit, ripe tannins provide structure.",90,33.0,Tuscany
60270,US,"A big, vital wine, mouth-filling and dense, with plenty of weight and volume, and deep flavors of earth, chocolate, blackberry and sweet currant. The cool '09 vintage has resulted in this version of Cask 23 being lighter in alcohol and tighter than others like the 2008. It's not quite as fat or immediately accessible as those vintages, but it is very fine, and should reward at least 10 years in the cellar, although you can certainly drink it now after a few hours in the decanter.",94,210.0,California
60271,France,"The soft, gentle lift of lemon peel sets the pure tone, with concentrated yet light-footed freshness on the palate. This wine is dry, crystalline and friendly, with a zesty finish.",90,23.0,Alsace
60272,France,"Blending Négrette with Syrah and Cabernet Franc, this rich, full-in-the-mouth rosé is ripe and packed with red berry fruits and a touch of spice. The up-front fruitiness of the wine is leavened with a fresh, crisp aftertaste.",86,15.0,Southwest France
60273,US,"There's an honest suggestion of bacon and eggs at first in this wine, which follows with a tangy entry that sizzles on the palate. Full, luscious and honeyed in oak, it's a powerful expression that's also balanced between fruit and nuance.",92,39.0,California
60274,US,"This Ponzi-owned vineyard is in the Chehalem Mountains AVA, yet is listed simply as Willamette Valley. Aromatically intense and intriguing, it opens quickly with scents of chamomile, plum, peach and apricot, leading to hints of honey and tea.

60276,US,"Made in a light-bodied, lower-alcohol style, this Pinot feels silky and gentle in the mouth. It really delivers when it comes to flavor. Displays big, impressive notes of raspberries, cherries, Dr. Pepper cola, red licorice, beef jerky and smoky sandalwood that are complex and satisfying, and that finish entirely dry. Drink now and over the next four years.",92,44.0,California
60277,US,"A blend of Cabernet Sauvignon, Malbec and Merlot, this is a gorgeous wine. Tasted in a flight of more expensive wines, it performed well, due to its class and deliciousness. It's concentrated in black currant, cassis liqueur, dark chocolate and anise, accented with toasty oak. The tannins are thick and refined. You'll want to cellar this wine until 2018 or beyond.",92,42.0,California
60278,Italy,"Made with Sangiovese and 3% Cabernet Sauvignon, it opens with aromas of plum, berry, spice, leather and a hint of toast.

60280,Spain,"Rubbery, rooty aromas of herbs and berries blend with stalky red-fruit notes. This feels shrill and tangy, with hard tannins, while flavors of roasted berry fruits come with a leafy undercurrent. Roasted, herbal, oaky flavors settle in on a juicy, high-acid finish. Drink through 2020.",89,85.0,Northern Spain
60281,US,"A little heavy and soft, with jelled raspberry, cola and vanilla flavors. The finish turns sugary.",83,20.0,California
60282,US,"Off-dry and stainless steel fermented, it carries some volatile scents in the nose. Bubble gum and candied orange flavors quickly turn bitter as the wine flattens out in the mouth.",82,15.0,Washington
60283,US,"The Ribbon Ridge AVA is home to a small, select group of near-cult wineries, and fruit such as this is the reason why. Compact and refined, it delivers beautiful aromas of raspberries, with a subtle dustiness that might be Oregon's answer to Napa's famed Rutherford dust.

60284,US,"Warm caramel-laden notes of French toast and baking bread mix with black-cherry paste and shaved vanilla on the nose of this bottling.

The medium tannins are approachable, making this easy to drink right now.",91,34.0,California

60286,US,"Thick, rich and ripe in vanilla, the American oak in this wine is pronounced and intense, wrapping itself around notes of candied apple and toffee-caramel.",87,34.0,California
60287,US,"This is the real deal, as they say, a fine, intricate Pinot Noir. The vineyard is famous for producing complex wines, and the winemaker has vinified the grapes well, resulting in a dry, silky wine. Waves of raspberries and cherries are balanced with earthier notes of mushrooms and minerals. The wine should age well for a good eight years, but it's easy to enjoy now.",92,48.0,California
60288,Italy,"The best Sassicaia of the last 10 years, the 2004 vintage is an outstanding achievement. Cabernet Sauvignon and Cabernet Franc highlight the beauty of Tuscany and portray the region in terms of thick chocolate fudge, succulent cherry and currant, exotic spice and vanilla seed. Beyond those big aromas are little teasers: blue flowers, Mediterranean herbs, cola and light mineral shadings. It's lush and full in the mouth and will hold 20 or 30 years.",97,190.0,Tuscany
60289,US,"Pure Merlot, from the Red Mountain vineyard, this displays that AVA's stiff, hard-edged tannins, keeping the fruit pinned down into a compact core. Cassis and black cherry, iron filings and some tar are all carefully balanced. There's plenty of muscle for further aging, and a hint of heat in the finish.",89,45.0,Washington
60290,New Zealand,"As typical for Dry River Pinots, this one is pretty surly in its youth. Intense and astringent, it packs layers of dusty black-cherry fruit into a tightly coiled frame. Try after 2019.",91,120.0,Martinborough
60291,Spain,"Aromas of raisin and cassis lean in the direction of overripe. This is less elegant and more blocky than most bottlings of Unico, but with ripe, loamy blackberry and plum flavors, it tastes great. A slightly hollow but round finish with mild residual tannins suggests that this be drunk now through 2024.",92,450.0,Northern Spain

60293,New Zealand,"Gibbston Valley is one of the coolest parts of Central Otago, so its fruit is often blended with that from other regions. This medium-bodied wine is all Gibbston—tart, wiry and herbal, with pie cherry fruit and lemony acids on the finish. Despite all that, the tannins are nicely ripe.",86,60.0,Central Otago
60294,Germany,"A rich layer of caramelized honey penetrates through bristling limes, lemons and tangerines in this sprightly medium-sweet Riesling. It's light as a feather yet pulsating with sweet yellow peach and apricot flavors. Vibrantly acidic but nuanced and substantial, it drinks gorgeously now but has enough substance to age well through at least 2025.",94,34.0,Mosel
60295,Italy,"This has a bright pink color and unique aromas of wild berry and forest floor, with delicate menthol overtones. A blend of Pinot Noir, Lagrein, Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot, it's mouthfeel is more structured and firm than standard rosé. Pair this with white meat or salted cod.",87,16.0,Northeastern Italy
60296,US,"This rather exotic Riesling was fermented and aged in barrels, 43% new, and the rest once-used. The barrel treatment takes it away from any ordinary Riesling characteristics, yielding a wine that has much in common with Viognier—floral and buttery, with substantial alcohol.",91,22.0,Washington
60297,Germany,"One of the palest icewines to come across our tasting table, this is an extraordinarily fine example, with great purity of fruit and incredible balance. Tangerine and pineapple flavors shine with pristine clarity from start to finish, making it very drinkable.",95,448.0,Mosel
60298,US,"Lots of tough, old-fashioned tannins on this pugnacious young Cabernet. While it has a good core of blackberries and currants, it's pretty brutal on the palate. Hard to tell if the fruit will outlast the astringency. Try after 2018.",88,54.0,California
60299,France,"Light, fruity and balanced, this combines acidity, red fruit and a bright feel. For drinking over this year.",86,15.0,Provence
60300,US,"The use of 100% Syrah gives a deep pink color that borders on purple. Aromas are rather strong too, with the flaky, buttered crust of a hot cherry pie running into the more bitter elements of citrus rinds. Those characters play leading roles on the palate as well, cherry candy toying with just-ripe grapefruit, providing tensions that keeps the sipping interesting. Just 72 cases produced.",87,22.0,California
60301,Germany,"While sunny and ripe with scents of tropical fruit, orange and peach, this bang-for-your-buck Riesling reveals surprising complexities. It's sweet and lusciously fruity on the palate, but nuanced with rambling layers of dried herbs, earth and mineral tones. Finishes long with a lingering tea-leaf astringency.",87,8.0,Mosel
60302,US,"Polished and varietal, this shows the skills of winemaker Chuck Reininger. The 2006 vintage produced tight, hard-edged, herbal wines, ageworthy but unyielding. But here it has been honed and softened, so that its Bordeaux-like traits are emphasized, with plenty of herbal character and spicy purple fruits. Still coming out of its shell, this is a wine to cellar and drink with a big, grilled steak.",90,38.0,Washington
60303,US,"Scents of smoke and sweet roasted chestnuts add a warm, rustic tone to this medium-dry Riesling. Deeply concentrated, with ripe yellow peach and apricot flavors, it's brightened by a shower of lemonade acidity and a snappy lemon-rind finish.",86,17.0,New York
60304,Chile,"Salinic and pungent, with celery, green citrus and nettle aromas. This is pure SB, although it's not 100% SB because Secreto always has a little something else in the blend. Fresh, acidic and alive, with lime and slightly pickled accents to the finish.",87,14.0,Casablanca Valley
60305,US,"This vineyard has already established itself as a premier Riesling site, but Chardonnay is increasingly gaining attention. Aromas of lees, mineral, toast and spice lead to an elegant but well-balanced palate, with flavors that linger.",89,22.0,Washington
60306,Italy,"Blue flower, moist soil, black berries and leather lead the nose on this vibrant blend of 80% Sangiovese, 10% Cabernet Sauvignon and 10% Merlot. The savory palate doles out black cherry, red currants, white pepper, clove and a hint of mocha alongside velvety tannins and fresh acidity.",90,19.0,Tuscany
60307,Chile,"Silly name and label, but not a bad wine. The nose is meaty, medicinal and fails to hold its form over extended airing, but early on it's good and honest, as is the palate of herbal tomato and cassis flavors. A little bit scrappy, but for $10 it's better than most.",85,10.0,Central Valley
60308,Argentina,Scratchy aromas of red fruits come with a chemical note of paint that feels hard and forced. Vanilla-like oak collides with green notes and bitterness that lead to a buttery finish.,81,15.0,Mendoza Province
60309,US,"Made from the two Cabs plus Syrah, this bottling shows its typicity in the rustic mouthfeel and exuberant berry, spice and cocoa flavors. It's a dry, lusty red that will happily wash down savory stews and roasts.",86,42.0,California

60311,France,"Strong wood aromas lead to a wine that is still very young. The smoky wood character dominates the red berry fruits and typical acidity of the vintage. It does have the weight to develop well, so give this structured wine until 2017.",87,,Bordeaux
60312,France,"This ripe wine from a very fine vintage in Bergerac, is fully structured while also having a fine black-currant fruitiness. Half-and-half Merlot and Cabernet Franc, it has a perfumed edge along with rich juicy acidity and fruits. Drink this fine wine from late 2017.",90,13.0,Southwest France
60313,France,"With its honeyed aromas, this is a warm and rich wine. It has some ripe, buttery flavors alongside more fruity apples and pears. It is smoothly textured, feeling ripe and ready to drink by 2015.",89,,Burgundy
60314,Chile,"Briar patch, some green pepper and a little sweet baking spice carry the nose. The plum and berry flavors are accented by brown sugar and caramel, but also some green characteristics. The finish is smooth, but too green.",83,9.0,Casablanca Valley
60315,New Zealand,"This wine is on the light side, with pretty cherry and mushroom flavors. Crisp and stony on the palate, a mouthwatering tartness rings on the finish. Drink now.",86,,Nelson

60317,US,"This Merlot-dominated blend features juicy berry flavors and tart, citrusy acids. It has gentle details of pepper, herb, lemon verbena and orange peel. It's a pleasure to see more elegant complexity in these latest Spring Valley reds.",92,50.0,Washington
60318,France,"89-91 Barrel sample. Solidly packed tannins, very firm and structured, a feeling of considerable extract as well as a high toast content.",90,,Bordeaux
60319,US,"This unusual wine, fermented with wild yeasts and using 20% whole bunches, is still pulling all of its diverse components into focus. Grapefruit, citrus, lemon and a saline quality adorn the spare red fruits. The length and persistence are spot on, but this could benefit from another year or two of bottle age before you pop the cork.",90,60.0,Oregon
60320,Chile,"Sharp aromas of prickly red fruits and barrel scents are lively, while a dry palate comes with a resiny coating of oak. Flavors of earthy berry, pepper and herbs finish minty in flavor, with unresolved tomato-like acidity.",85,19.0,Cachapoal Valley
60321,France,"This family estate, established since the 14th century, has produced a light, beautifully fruity wine in the difficult 2013 vintage. With red fruits and soft tannins, it is fully of ripe berry flavors cut by acidity.A light structure in the background will allow the wine to age, although it is ready to drink now.",88,23.0,Burgundy
60322,Germany,"Dusty mineral notes persist on this elegant, invigorating semidry Riesling. It's intensely tart with acidity, but sunny rays of yellow peach and tangerine build towards the midpalate. The finish is kissed with honey and lemon tea.",89,34.0,Mosel
60323,US,"Fully mature, this calls to mind an inexpensive village Burgundy: one that is just a touch past its prime. Delicate secondary fruit flavors and firm acidity are in place, with residual hints of tomato leaf and flesh.",87,30.0,Oregon
60324,US,"Bright raspberry aromas are cut by a slightly funky touch of composting violets, dried bay leaf and animal hide on this deeply layered bottling from the legendary producer. The palate is equally complex, with mulberry, tangy cranberry, juniper and earthy mushrooms. It offers a great experience for the price.",92,28.0,California
60325,New Zealand,"Cinnamon is prominent on the nose of this wine, while bright berry, cherry, black olive and floral notes linger in the background. The acidity is a little slow to arrive on the palate but when it does it mingles seamlessly with fine grained tannins. The midpalate is a little flat but the fruit creeps back in at the end.",88,25.0,Central Otago
60326,Australia,"Prickly refers to the wine's texture, which is definitely lightly frizzante (spritzy). That helps boost the wine's aromas, making it perfumed and floral, even Muscat-like. It's light in body and slightly off dry, with notes of apricot, apple blossom and gingery spice. Drink now.",87,11.0,Victoria
60327,US,"This is a sound, rustic red wine. It's comprised of undisclosed varieties, but tastes basically like a Rhône blend, with simple cherry, cola, herb and oak flavors.",84,15.0,California

60330,Chile,"Punchy citrus aromas are natural like they should be for an unoaked wine. Angular and a bit sharp on the palate, this spunky style of Chardonnay deals tart peach and nectarine flavors in front of a fresh finish that's a touch sour.",87,13.0,Casablanca Valley
60331,Spain,"Earthy cherry and plum aromas come with hints of sweet plastic and heat. This is plenty strong on the palate, with just enough elegance and restraint to create a sense of comfort. Ripe berry and plum flavors are syrupy at first then loamy, while the finish is steady and solid. Drink through 2018.",90,33.0,Catalonia
60332,France,"Fresh and fruity, this wine is full of black currants and acidity that is structured by a core of dark tannins. While it is firm at the moment it's likely to fill out, with the fresh fruitiness emerging. Drink from 2017.",85,18.0,Bordeaux
60333,France,"Initially rough around the edges, this wine opens up to give warm red berry fruits, firm tannins and a solid structure. Underlying tannins give a dry core. A more juicy, fresh aftertaste means this wine needs some aging. Drink from 2017.",88,25.0,Bordeaux
60334,Australia,"This is a lean, austere—even a bit severe—Riesling that looks to need a good five years or more to mellow. Crushed stone and citrus pith finish long and painfully tart.",89,35.0,South Australia
60335,Germany,"While sprightly and lean in style, this dry, mineral-tinged Riesling seems to round out on the palate, building in ripe white-peach and grapefruit flavors. Penetrating lemon-lime acidity wins out on the finish, along with a pleasant bite of citrus zest.",92,65.0,Mosel
60336,Chile,"Sharp pointy aromas of citrus and green herbs are edgy. This feels minerally and citric, with no excess weight. Flavors of tangerine, lemon and passion fruit are pickled and briny, while this retains a salty slightly green character on the finish.",88,16.0,Leyda Valley

60338,Spain,"Very nice red wine but for $112 we want to be forced to take notice, and frankly that doesn't really happen here. Still, the wine goes snap, crackle and pop on both the bouquet and palate. It's a crisp one, with live-wire cherry, cola and spice flavors. Not at all flabby, and instead runs lean and fresh. Good now and maybe better in a few more years.",88,112.0,Catalonia
60339,US,"This wine offers notes of woodspice, butterscotch, coffee and blackberry. The fruit flavors are lighter in style with mouthwatering acids and firm, grippy tannins that need some time or perhaps a big, juicy steak to tame them.",89,45.0,Washington
60340,Chile,"Gritty, spicy aromas of kirsch, dried cherry and cinnamon set up a narrow, high-acid palate that's fresh but grating. Baking spice, eucalyptus and tomato accent plum and red-currant fruit, while the finish tastes herbal, spicy and oaky, with lasting acidity.",89,24.0,Maipo Valley

60342,US,"This is the winery's French-oaked Syrah, thick and smoky, with a balanced mix of red and black fruits, nicely retained acids, and layers of creamy oak.

60343,US,"This coastal wine hails from two sites, including the Gloria Vineyard in Sebastopol, and Hummingbird Hill in the Petaluma Gap. It stays true to form in its light approach and high-toned acidity. Earthy, light in color and bristling in black tea, cranberry and pomegranate, it's lightly spiced in cardamom.",91,33.0,California
60344,US,"This is a rich, lush, full-bodied expression of the variety, exhibiting oak in its classic rendering of caramel apple. Textured and thick, it has a tartness that balances some of the ripeness on the finish.",86,65.0,California
60345,Germany,"Perfumed florals mingle curiously with deep, dusty mineral notes on this bracing TBA. Sunny nectarine and tangerine flavors are mouthwatering and juicy, struck with acidity, then plunged into pools of sweet honey and nectar. It's a delightful sensory roller coaster that feels endless on the finish.",95,775.0,Rheingau
60346,US,"Big and full-bodied for a Pinot Noir, almost like a Grenache in its rich cherry and red currant power. It's a good wine, delicious in its own way, but an outlier for a Sonoma Coast Pinot Noir.",87,30.0,California
60347,US,"Rich but not overly dense, this 100% varietal wine from a vineyard known also for Zinfandel and Cabernet Sauvignon is wickedly generous in chocolate mocha, full bodied yet balanced. It finishes in a flurry of black pepper and leather.",88,65.0,California

60349,France,"Not many people have châteaus named after them. But Caroline Chanfreau-Philippon does and now she runs it as part of Château Lestage, both Cru Bourgeois. This is a rich and structured wine that is concentrated, ripe and juicy. With both attractive black-currant fruits typical of the vintage and firm tannins with tight structure, drink this wine from 2020.",91,29.0,Bordeaux
60350,US,"Another superb Cinq Cépages. A blend of all five classic Bordeaux grape varieties-, but based on Cabernet Sauvignon, it is both immediately pleasurable and intensely complex. Waves of black currants, dark chocolate, green olives, licorice and toasty oak roll across the palate, wrapped into firm, dusty tannins. Very good now but should develop further over the next 8–10 years. Easy to find, with 5,500 cases produced.",94,75.0,California
60351,US,"This treads the line between slightly rustic and refined. The tannins are sandpapery, and it has lots of zingy acidity, making the wine feel a little rough. But the core of blackberry fruit is rich and dynamic. Probably not an ager, so give it a good decanting, and drink it over the next 2–3 years.",87,35.0,California

60354,US,"Dusty mineral and bramble notes juxtapose bright raspberry and sour-cherry notes in this full-bodied rosé.

60355,Germany,"Waxy lanolin and spice notes add complexity to tart stone-fruit aromas on this sprightly Riesling. Semidry in style, the palate drips with peach nectar flavor, balanced by bracing tangerine acidity. It finishes long, with a refreshing spray of herb notes.",90,28.0,Mosel
60356,US,"Co-fermented with 5% Viognier, mineral-laden aromas of smoked meat, Kalamata olive, earth, flower and funk are followed by shimmering fruit and savory flavors that possess a compelling mouthfeel and lead to an extended finish. The alcohol and oak are dialed back, allowing the fruit to shine.",93,70.0,Washington

60363,US,"Well made in a lighter style, this offers strawberry and raspberry fruit, tart acids, and a tight, somewhat tannic exit. This winery has dramatically reduced the alcohol levels of their wines over the past few years—by what means we do not know—but the 13.1% listed here feels a little thin.",86,60.0,Oregon

60473,US,"Bright and cheerful with a candied black cherry nose, this is a deliciously fruit-forward yet focused wine. On the palate, soft, fresh fruit and supple vanilla flavors meld beautifully with supple tannins and a rich, dark, roasted coffee finish.",87,35.0,New York
60474,Israel,"Lime pith, green plum and white clover aromas lead the nose of this Sauv Blanc, and the mouth offers similarly tart and tight flavors. The short finish favors white grapefruit accented by green grass.",84,18.0,Galilee
60475,US,"A good, everyday wine showing how well Paso Robles ripens Cabernet. It's filled with savory blackberry and cherry flavors that go down nice and easy, leading to a spicy finish. Drink now–2014.",87,19.0,California
60476,Italy,"This full-bodied red opens with aromas of anisette, leather, menthol and forest floor. The dense, juicy palate offers black cherry, coffee, licorice and clove while fine-grained tannins offer support.",90,,Tuscany
60477,US,"This tiny-production wine shows an attention to detail in the vineyard and cellar. The clonal selection shines, given partial barrel-fermentation, partial stainless steel, all aged in mostly neutral French oak. Honeysuckle aromas jump from the glass, followed by viscous, juicy tropical elements of mango and lychee. It finishes dry and lemony.",92,24.0,California
60478,US,"Hard and tannic at first, this young wine grudgingly reveals a core of very tart cherry fruit, encased in flavors of stem and wood. A coffee-infused finish does not conceal the chewy, tough tannins.",86,24.0,Washington
60479,France,"An elegant wine, smooth and rounded, bringing out smoky fruits over tannins that smooth out as the fruit unfolds. Less opulent than some previous vintages, the wine shows restraint and aging potential.",93,,Bordeaux
60480,France,"88-90 Barrel sample. The second wine of Château Palmer is light, fresh and fruity, with accessible blackcurrant fruits. There is a light touch of wood, with delicious, easy juicy acidity.",89,,Bordeaux
60481,Australia,"Tangy melon and citrus flavors and a steely backbone characterize Merrill's reserve Chardonnay. There's oak here—mostly present on the nutty, toasty nose—but there's not much of it rounding out the palate, which makes it feel a little disjointed. Still, a very good wine.",87,26.0,South Australia
60482,US,"This Chardonnay needs a few more months to come around. It's tart with acidity, along with oak and tropical fruit flavors that have plenty of potential, but haven't meshed together yet.",87,35.0,California
60483,Argentina,"A lightly charred, foresty nose includes aromas of blackberry, cassis, hard spices, licorice and leather. This is lively but balanced in terms of feel, with richness and raciness playing off each other. Flavors of baked black fruits, peppery spice and licorice finish dark, long and bright, with juicy acidity that will keep this healthy for years to come. Drink through 2024.",93,120.0,Mendoza Province
60484,Greece,"Red cherry, vanilla, spicebox and a touch of flowers leads the nose on this poised Merlot/Limnio blend. On the palate, the wine is elegant and laced with clove, mushroom and bright berry flavors. A unique wine at an unbeatable price.",87,8.0,Halkidiki
60485,US,"Still young and tight, this breathes open slowly, with bright and expressive raspberry fruit. There's a pleasantly buttery edge to the mouthfeel, and the tannins, though still stiff, are polished and nicely balance out the finish. Drink 2018 to 2026.",91,48.0,Oregon
60486,US,"Tight and youthful, this wine unwinds slowly, in full command of its power and intensity. Compost, wild strawberry and a hit of citrus give life to the generous tannin and oak character, while savory black tea and cocoa flavors provide bite.",92,66.0,California
60487,US,"Plum and especially blueberry fruit compels your interest immediately. It's cloaked in precisely focused tannins that frame an extended, lightly chocolaty finish.",90,23.0,Washington
60488,France,"An impressively structured wine from an estate that is at the forefront of quality in Pessac-Léognan. It is balanced, a rich rounded wine, with considerable depths of black fruits, dark tannins and power.",94,,Bordeaux
60489,Italy,"Alle Viole has a large Sangiovese element that lends aromas of wild berry, violets, almond skin, wet earth and tobacco. The wine is compact and smooth, making it a perfect companion to risotto with wild porcini mushrooms.",88,16.0,Tuscany
60490,US,"In keeping with the voluptuous approachability of the 2007 vintage, this 100% Cabernet Sauvignon is simply fabulous now for its flood of the ripest, sweetest blackberrries, cherries, cassis and chocolate imaginable. Especially noble is the tannin structure, firm and soft, dry and sweet, a combination of opposites. The depth is vast, and the spicy finish goes on for a long time, suggesting the wine's concentration. Simply a joy to drink, it should develop over many years, but you might want to err on the side of youthfulness and open it by 2015.",97,225.0,California
60491,Chile,"Dusty earth, seashell notes and tomato aromas don't fully announce how snappy, tart and racy this coastal PN is. Almost sour red-plum and pie-cherry flavors finish angular, sharp and zesty to an extreme.",86,17.0,Leyda Valley
60492,US,"Earthy aromas of juniper and forest floor give depth to the rusty cherry, tart cranberry, dried hibiscus and pepper-dust scents on the nose of this bottling from the historic vineyard. Soft in structure at first, it then delivers a firmer tannic edge in the midpalate, all the while delivering vivacious red fruit and pine-forest flavors. It will age very well.",92,70.0,California
60493,Italy,"A blend of Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, Cabernet Franc, Barbera and Nebbiolo (in decreasing amounts), this opens with green aromas of dried herb and olive, followed by hints of black fruit and tobacco. It also shows bright acidity and good structure on the finish.",87,18.0,Lombardy
60494,US,"This is a ripe year, but this vineyard designation isn't quite as tropical as their Côte Sud. It's more of a precise style, but there are also some hints of grass, onion and herb. Interesting, but very slightly off.",86,35.0,Oregon
60495,US,"Spicy and floral, with super concentration, this fruit bomb of a wine is 100% Riesling, though the aromatics have the rose petal, soapy character of some Washington Gewürztraminers. The depth and intensity of the fruit are remarkable, but may make this a challenge to match with food, even spicy Asian noodle dishes.",89,22.0,Washington
60496,US,"Blackberry, cherry and plum notes form this estate wine's fruity core, complemented by an earthy thread of cedar, pencil and tobacco. Dry, firm tannins give it a structure that takes time to unwind, the finish marked by powerful grace and spicy clove.",91,65.0,California
60497,Italy,"In reaction to Mount Etna's volcanic eruptions, local farmers have adopted a unique mix of Christianity and mysticism to protect against imminent dangers. Many vineyard sites are anointed with religious names, like Santo Spirito, as if the name were a lucky charm in itself. This delightful vineyard-designate wine is ethereal and bright, with loads of small berry intensity and a dusty, dry finish.",92,40.0,Sicily & Sardinia
60498,US,"This reserve-level bottling spends 15 months in French oak, and remains tight and hard, with blocky cranberry and strawberry fruit. It thins out quickly, with a reductive hint of rubber in the finish.",87,70.0,Oregon
60499,Italy,"Burned tire rubber, oak, espresso and roasted coffee bean lead the nose on this extracted wine. The dense, monolithic palate offers sweet vanilla, toasted oak, chocolate, stewed prunes marinated in spirits, and overripe, sugary plum. It's already evolved and lacks energy.",86,45.0,Tuscany
60500,South Africa,"This is a robust Sauvignon Blanc that announces itself with aromas of grass, spice and straw, leading into a combination of fresh fruit and earthy spice flavors. A great balance of acid, fruit and spice means it's assertive, but still poised. A fun wine with lots of character.",87,11.0,Coastal Region
60501,US,"A great value at this price. Shows beautiful crispness and minerality, with ripe flavors of pineapples, limes and green apples. There's a honeyed richness to the finish, but the wine is fundamentally dry.",87,12.0,California
60502,US,"More complex than the winery's appellation blend, yet also requiring time to reach full potential, this shows delicate lemon slices, honeysuckle, surf wax, pink grapefruit and a touch of coconut on the nose. The palate is grippy in texture and sizzling with mouthwatering acidity, offering lemon rind, grapefruit spritz and petrol flavors. Expect inviting nut and honey-dust flavors to emerge. Drink 2018–2034.",91,28.0,California
60503,US,"Ham sandwiches, fried chicken, potato salad and fruit salad are just a few of the things this rich, honeyed wine will complement. With flavors of lemons, limes, pineapples and vanilla, it's balanced with crisp acidity.",86,18.0,California
60504,US,"This barrel selection, Keller's best, is an elaborate and complex Pinot Noir. It shows classic coastal acidity, with deep, delicious flavors of raspberries, cherries, mocha, licorice, spices and sweet sandalwood. The tannins are rich enough to let it age over the next six years.",93,75.0,California
60505,US,"This wine is hugely robust in concentration and power, a study in mountain-grown brambly berry and serious tannin. Bark, pencil and a wealth of spiced plum form the core of its character, with secondary elements of cherry and cigar box coming into play over time. Enjoy best beginning in 2024 through 2034.",94,110.0,California
60506,US,"Tart Montmorency cherry meshes with a cedary cigar-box note on the nose of this wine. The palate is fruit-driven with ripe cherries and blueberries, lifted slightly by anise and bay-leaf spices.",87,,California
60507,France,"A soft ripe wine, this is elegant and with a light layer of tannins to give structure. The wine is now mature with juicy acidity giving way to secondary flavors. The finish brings out a more structured dryness. Drink now.",88,,Burgundy
60508,US,"Ripe and fruity, rich and generous, almost soft in texture, this starts with strawberry-syrup aromas, then tastes like sweet red cherries with light spicy oak accents. It's basically a big soft pillow of fruitiness, but a touch of tannin kicks in on the finish to keep it refreshing.",90,48.0,California
60509,US,"A pale-pink color, this Syrah rosé brings aromas that start out a bit reduced. This is followed by notes of strawberry, apple, melon and herb. It drinks a hair off dry, with plentiful strawberry and cherry flavors. What it lacks in complexity it makes up for with easy-drinking appeal.",88,12.0,Washington
60510,France,"Soft, lilting wine that is gentle, ripe and ready to drink. The fruits have some sweetness, the tannins are light, and the acidity is fresh and never too intrusive.",87,35.0,Burgundy
60511,US,"This best-of-barrels bottling is intended to impress with its weight and gravitas, and it succeeds despite exhibiting more restraint than in previous vintages. Plush red strawberry and plum fruit is spiced with star anise and clove on the nose. The palate combines a sanguine element with smoky oak notes. Vanilla bean and ginger snap flavors extend toward the finish, which proves rather refreshing.",94,65.0,California
60512,US,"Enormously rich, this Pinot Noir has gigantic fruit flavors of blackberries, cherries, raspberries, cola, mocha, anise and pepper. Some will call it a fruit bomb because it doesn't have much structure to balance all that extravagance.",85,50.0,California
60513,France,"Vidal-Fleury ages its wines longer than most other Rhône firms, so don't be concerned that this is “a year behind” other Tavels on the market. It's the one rosé appellation that can handle a bit of bottle age, so this is at its peak. It shows typical Tavel weight and richness, but also savory, almost meaty or mushroomy elements, balanced by bright citrus notes. Drink now.",90,24.0,Rhône Valley
60514,US,"Crisp upon entry, this wine evolves into a thicker, richer style of texture and ripe flavor, with a depth of caramel streaking through baked apple and pear compote with a medley of melon. It satisfies in its full-bodied generosity.",88,25.0,California
60515,Chile,"This mature wine is a touch gritty and baked on the nose, and the palate has some scratch and choppiness to the mouthfeel. But core flavors of stewed berry, baked plum and cherry are good, and the finish of molasses, brown sugar and ripe berry fruit has its merits. Drink now.",88,28.0,Colchagua Valley
60516,Italy,"This Merlot and Cabernet Sauvignon blend sees 16 months in barrique; the result is redolent of chocolate, roasted coffee bean, vanilla and dried herbs backed by lovely fresh blueberry and blackberry. It's creamy and smooth in the mouth with very good freshness and length.",90,50.0,Tuscany
60517,Spain,"This is an edgy wine with a mix of berry and cassis aromas along with harsh leather. It's mouthfilling and potent on the palate, where flavors of spiced berry and herbal-infused plum finish scratchy and with all the muscle one could ask for. Cariñena, Garnacha and Syrah is the blend.",87,18.0,Catalonia
60518,US,"This straddles the border between tasting dry and slightly sweet. It has good acidity, with flavors of citrus, mint green tea and vanilla.",86,22.0,California

60520,France,"The wine is ripe, balanced and likely to be ready to drink soon. With its plump fruitiness and texture, it is a full wine. Rich red-berry fruits are gently balanced by acidity and supported with a light layer of tannins. It will be very drinkable from late 2017.",88,32.0,Burgundy
60521,France,"This rich, dense and complex wine has good structure, dark tannins and bright black-currant fruitiness. It's a wine with a good future, and aging will allow the tannins to soften and add further lift to the fruit. Drink from 2016.",88,28.0,Bordeaux

60526,US,"This complex white comes from cuttings procured in 2004 from one of the oldest surviving vineyards of this variety, thought to have originated in the Loire Valley, then replanted by the producer onto older rootstock.

The mouthfeel is creamy and velvety, with plush tannins and lingering baking-spice flavors.",89,25.0,France Other
60528,US,"Made with 75% Sangiovese, with the rest Cabernet Sauvignon and Barbera, this wine has aromas of barrel spices, coffee, dark raspberries and herbs. It's medium bodied with plump fruit flavors, tart acids and a lightly chalky feel.",86,12.0,Washington

60534,US,"This easygoing wine falls into the soft side, bordering on a soapy mouthfeel. Flavors of banana-cream and coconut-cream pie abound, with 30% new oak making its impact felt. The finish is yeasty. This is best enjoyed well chilled.",86,14.0,Oregon
60535,US,"Some hints of sweetness and a touch of minerality annotate this wine, which bursts with flavors of peaches and tangerines. It's dry enough to pair with most Riesling friendly fare, and in many ways the most accessible and fruit-forward of Trisaetum's eight Rieslings.",92,28.0,Oregon
60536,France,"While this wine has obviously seen plenty of wood aging, it's also full of dark blackberry fruit. Together, those qualities give density and structure, with acidity and fruitiness to match. Drink from 2021.",90,18.0,Bordeaux
60537,US,"Pungent, high-pitched notes of turmeric and dried flower hit the nose first, with underlying scents of tobacco, char and cassis. The palate is medium bodied and chocolaty, and it bears chalky tannins that keep the finish firm.",85,21.0,New Mexico
60538,US,"The wine is pale in color and very light in body, neither of which is a bad thing. You want some delicacy in a Pinot Noir. The drawback is in a candied simplicity to the flavors, which are of Lifesaver cherries and raspberries.",86,50.0,California

60540,Chile,"This is heady for Chilean Chardonnay, with baked apple and no shortage of toast on the bouquet. It feels fresh but full, with polish and elegance to the mouthfeel.

60544,France,"This is a rich, rounded wine, yet it also expresses a tight texture and nervy acidity.

60545,Chile,"Edgy, nervy and funky, with unfamiliar aromas and flavors. The nose is pickled and the palate is tart, linear and green.

60552,Chile,"Narrow, forward black cherry aromas are dark and positive. It's a bit choppy and showing acidity on the palate, with plum, red berry and additional edgy zest.

60555,US,"This is dry and brisk in acidity, with firm tannins and great structural integrity. At the same time, it's vast in blackberry and cherry-jam flavors, while the oak overlay is strong but perfectly matched with the wine's volume. Very fine, complex and elegant, this is a Cabernet to cellar for eight years; it could be one for the long haul.",95,80.0,California
60556,France,"This wine brings together the two native grapes of Gaillac in one ripe, light and fruity whole. It has soft tannins and fine juicy acidity. There is a youthful rusticity to the wine and a crisp bright red-fruit aftertaste. Drink from 2018.",88,16.0,Southwest France

60558,France,"Smoke, orange, wet stone and earth notes are powerful and beguiling on the nose. The palate has absolute concentration and energy and more of that smoky promise. This is like the bundled focus of a laser light—incisive, precise and piercing. Notions of peach, lemon and tangerine dance and hover, but the central core and force remains a kind of drive that could move mountains. This is a sleeping giant, absolute and pure, brooding, laying in wait to unleash its might. The palate is absolutely dry, absolutely fresh, absolutely uncompromising. The finish is piercingly clean.

60570,Chile,"In recent years, with winemaker Enrique Tirado firmly at the helm, Don Melchor has gotten better and better. And while 2004 was an average year in Chile, this ranks as the best Melchor we've sampled. The wine has beautiful blackberry, cola and pepper aromas in front of cassis, cherry, plum, nutmeg and cinnamon flavors. It's brawny but balanced, with excellent natural acidity. Best from 2008–2012.",92,50.0,Puente Alto
60571,US,"The vineyard is in Green Valley, the coolest part of the appellation. You'll find very high acidity and an austere, elegant wine in this extremely low-yield Pinot Noir. The flavors are right on the edge, balancing less ripe peppermint and tannic Chinese-tea notes with richer cherries and raspberries. This is really a thrilling young wine, and while it may hold for years, it's best now for its tense youth.",93,43.0,California

60629,Chile,"Early on this smells strained, like a haystack with brine. Give it time and it comes around, although it remains chunky in feel, with citrus and nectarine flavors. On the finish it's thick and heavy (14.4% ABV means weight and viscosity).",85,15.0,Casablanca & Leyda Valleys
60630,US,"Here's a big, flashy, cult-style wine if ever there was one. It offers masses of blackberries, black currants, coffee, spices and new oak. Vastly rich, it defines the Harlan Estate style, although, in this vintage, perhaps not quite at its highest expression. Nonetheless the wine is fat and unctuous and immediately drinkable, thanks to refined tannins. Yet it should age effortlessly through 2018.",94,500.0,California

60686,South Africa,"This approachable Cabernet-based blend, which also has 18% Pinotage, 11% Cab Franc and 2% Shiraz, is a spicy and balanced red with notes of menthol, purple florals, black cherry and berry.

With juicy blackberry fruits still so youthful, it is going to be ready drink from 2019.",89,40.0,Bordeaux
60695,Italy,"This savory wine has earthy and fruity fragrances of underbrush, spice and plum. The palate delivers a lush dark cherry flavor, accented by white pepper, cinnamon and licorice spice.

60697,US,"A scent of leathery funk inhabits this wine, yet never overtakes the balanced flavors. A mix of blueberry and cherry fills the palate with lush flavors, and highlights of coffee, mocha and salted caramel add further interest. It drinks as a more mature wine than the vintage date might suggest.",89,42.0,Oregon

60702,France,"A hint of caramelized apple clings to the nose, as well as a certain creaminess. The palate reveals a core of stone, chalk and lanolin, all framed with the purest notion of lemon zest.

60707,Germany,"Initial aromas of earth and smoke blow off with aeration to reveal intense yellow peach scents swathed with honeysuckle and fresh green herbs.

60721,Austria,"All the secrets of this wine are still locked away—only time will reveal them. There are glimpses of lemon and grapefruit and notions of yeast on a thrillingly pure, streamlined and linear palate. Right now there is fruit, with time there will be eternal stone.

60733,US,"A 50-case release from Six Sigma, this Sauvignon Blanc is fleshy, dark and complex, complete with lime, lemon and guava tones. It'll stand up to creamy shellfish dishes or a platter of fresh oysters—an intense study in barrel-kissed Lake County Sauvignon Blanc.",89,36.0,California
60734,US,"This is delicious, right up there with a great Cabernet. First of all, there's the smoothly tannic and velvety mouthfeel. Then there's the flavors that are wildly attractive in blackberries, black licorice, crispy bacon and something purple and flowery, like violets.

60737,France,"Lively aromas of grapefruit, white flowers and mineral lead into a light, fruity but rather simple palate that offers lime, green herb and stone. Overall it's straightforward and clean, but a touch dilute. In its favor, it's soft and easy to drink.",86,30.0,Loire Valley
60738,US,"This Cabernet is a mixed bag. It's oaky and also fruity, but a little vegetal, with some green notes alongside sweet raspberry and cherry candy and caramel flavors. A real disappointment, coming after a series of good bottlings, but the vintage was difficult.",86,135.0,California
60739,US,"Stiffly tannic, this is straight-on boysenberry juice, firm and full-bodied. It shows a little bit of earthiness, hints of herb and a citrusy zip to the acids. The alcohol, pushing 15%, does not intrude.",87,26.0,Washington
60740,France,"From a small estate of only 10 acres, this wine with its 60% Merlot is fruity with just the right amount of tannins. It has red fruit and crisp acidity along with a dry edge. The wine is likely to age quickly, so drink from 2019.",86,18.0,Bordeaux

60797,US,"A Merlot-based blend with 10% Cabernet Franc and 5% Petit Verdot, this offers forward aromas of dark cherry, blueberry compote and blackberry, which are offset by notes of pastry spice, char and tobacco.

60798,US,"This concentrated Pinot Noir calibrates power with finesse, juxtaposing rippling black cherry and berry flavors against complex mineral and earth tones.

While decadently delicious now, it has enough structure to age elegantly through 2019–2021.",92,30.0,New York

60803,US,"A wonderful wine from one of the best vineyards in Anderson Valley. It's a bit acidic and tannic now, the result of this cool vintage, but time in the bottle should soften and resolve the tartness and astringency. The wine itself is very dry, with flavors of cherries, cola, balsam, Asian spices and oak. Needs aging through at least 2012 to awaken it.",94,62.0,California
60804,Chile,"Translucent red in color, this coastal Pinot is light and peppery on the nose, with saline and celery stalk scents along with baked plum and raspberry notes.

60814,US,"A glamorous wine, rich and complex, with lots going on. Lacks perhaps some of the depth of, say, the '03 and '04, more on a par with the 2007, but still a very fine Insignia. With rich blackberry and cassis flavors wrapped into thick tannins and fine new oak sweetness, it's nowhere ready to drink now. Give it a rest until 2015.",93,200.0,California
60815,France,"91-93 Barrel sample. Belair has been given a new name, after Christian Moueix's grandmother, in honor of its purchase by the Moueix family. The wine is ripe, with its dark tannins and perfumed fruit, lifted by a final smoky character.",92,,Bordeaux

This wine cries out for a hearty dish of pasta or mildly seasoned cheeses.",89,25.0,Tuscany
60826,US,"Quite dark in the glass, this wine, which is made with 6% Viognier, shows the darkest of purple fruit scents on the nose, and needs quite a bit of time to start opening up, so tightly wound it is.

60901,France,Drouhin has significant holdings in a number of top Chambolle vineyards. This wine is a blend from other Premier Crus in the same village. It has the typical generous character along with a more serious structured backbone that gives a dry and solid density that's worth aging. Drink from 2017.,92,82.0,Burgundy
60902,Chile,"This is the third consecutive year this wine has been rated 92 points. It is dense and potent, with aromas of cola, pencil lead and wild berry.

60903,France,"This wine is dominated by Grenache, which makes up 80% of the blend. That gives the spice and pepper edge as well as bringing out delicious red-berry fruits and crisp acidity. The wine, with its bright aftertaste,is ready to drink now.",87,19.0,Provence
60904,US,"This vineyard has been source to some of the winery's greatest bottlings. The wine is enormously fruity, with raspberry, cherry and red-plum flavors that flood the palate. But it's no mere fruit bomb, offering the most wonderful tannin-acid structure and a dryness that keeps the wine stimulating through a long, spicy finish. Drinkable now, but also cellar worthy through 2018, at least.",95,57.0,California
60905,France,"A wood-laden bottling, produced from a selection of wines at Patache d'Aux. If the wood weren't currently so dominant, the blackberry fruits would have more of a chance. It obviously needs a year or two to smooth out and come into balance.",87,40.0,Bordeaux
60906,Spain,"A mix of floral and schisty cherry, raspberry and strawberry aromas are subtle, elegant and reserved. This blend of Garnacha and Syrah is fresh, but with a touch of jammy weight. Flavors of minerally plum and red currant are supported by oak and vanilla notes, while the finish is tight, racy and peppery in flavor. Drink through 2018.",90,31.0,Catalonia

60909,France,"Lightly herbaceous, this is a soft, open, easy wine for summer drinking. Attractive grapefruit, green apple and orange zest mix easily together.",86,,Bordeaux
60910,US,"Locked up tightly on first pour, this wine shows brooding aromas of black pepper, smoked meat, brown stems, olive and herbs. It explodes across the palate with rich yet elegant, nuanced savory flavors that lead to a hyperextended finish. It will be best after 2020.",95,65.0,Washington
60911,Germany,"Concentrated yellow peach and apricot are juxtaposed by bold streaks of lemon and lime acidity in this penetrating medium-sweet Riesling. Zesty and fresh, it finishes with a touch of crystalline minerality. Drink now through 2023.",90,20.0,Mosel
60912,US,"Planted in 1974, principally with Pinot Gris, this limited selection mixes high-acid citrus and pineapple flavors with a touch of leather and wild mountain-berry fruit. It's complex and hints at great detail, but remains stubbornly tight even after several hours. As with many Eyrie wines, the ageability is unquestioned, and this should continue to improve for many years to come.",91,80.0,Oregon
60913,Italy,"Very much a baby, this is one big, bold, burly Cab-Merlot-Syrah blend that's filled to the brim with extracted plum fruit, bitter chocolate and earth. It takes a long time in the glass for it to lose its youthful, funky aromatics, and on the palate things are still a bit scattered. But in due time things will settle and integrate",90,49.0,Tuscany
60914,US,"The aromas in this wine pop, with notes of dried herb, plum, vanilla and smoked meat. It brings a compelling sense of texture, coating the palate from end to end with exquisitely balanced fruit and savory flavors. It's a knockout at this price.",91,12.0,Washington
60915,US,"This widely available and comparatively cheap bottling nabbed quality fruit to present aromas of black raspberry, dark cranberry, crushed graphite and chaparral. There is refreshing if slightly dried fruit on the palate, where blackberry paste is lifted by thyme, marjoram and turned-earth flavors.",88,17.0,California
60916,US,"A savory, lightly herbal character complements raspberry and cherry flavors in this medium-bodied and well-balanced wine. It has light tannins for a little grip in the texture, and attractive complexity from the aroma to the finish.",89,28.0,California
60917,France,"A parcel within the Château Simard vineyard gives this wine that features plenty of fruitiness, with attractive acidity and black currant flavors. It also has structure, a touch of minerality and final, dry tannins, all of which will allow it to age. Drink from 2018.",88,35.0,Bordeaux
60918,Israel,"Deep ruby to the eye, this wine has a nose of fruits of the wood with a hint of roasted tomato. Tannins are surprisingly soft considering the depth of flavor, most notably black cherry, cranberry and smoke with touches of saddle leather. Velvety tannins cascade toward a finish that is equal parts bright and smoky.",90,25.0,Judean Hills
60919,France,"Firmly structured, this wine will be equally packed with ripe fruit. While the toast and tannin flavors soften, wait for those rich red plum and cherry tastes to come through. Balanced and solid, this dense wine should be drunk from 2018.",91,61.0,Burgundy
60920,France,"Superripe fruit gives the wine weight and richness, toast and peach and pineapple fruits. Old vines give the concentration and opulent fruit. Worth aging 2–3 years.",92,49.0,Burgundy

60923,France,"This is a heavily wooded wine, with tannins giving a firm and dry character at this stage. It has weight and a powerful structure, but needs time to develop riper fruit and plum flavors. It's always likely to show wood flavors, but certainly wait until 2017.",89,22.0,Southwest France
60924,Australia,"This is a pretty lean, tightly focused wine. Grilled pineapple and citrus notes broaden slightly on the midpalate, then come together again on the crisp, lemony finish. Drink now through the end of 2015.",90,15.0,Western Australia

60926,Italy,"Arnione, a blend of Cabernet, Merlot and Petit Verdot, packs heat and intensity and is a beautifully integrated and generous wine.

60930,US,"A nicely done wine, especially at the price. It's very pretty aromatically, boasting pear and vanilla notes, full in the mouth and lemony with minerality. “Jam” of Jam's Blend is a commingling of the names of the two Tortoise Creek founders, Janie and Mel Master, who source the grapes for this wine out of a Lodi Rules vineyard.",87,11.0,California
60931,Chile,"Spunky, piquant red-berry aromas contain elements of horsehide and grass. This feels mostly full and juicy, with good structure. Herbal, oaky plum and berry flavors end with a touch of oak spice and a lingering herbal, green component.",85,11.0,Central Valley
60932,US,"Shows slightly sweet flavors of pineapple marmalade, green apple tart, honeysuckle and buttered toast, fortunately balanced with crisp, citrusy acidity. It was made from grapes grown in the Los Alamos region of Santa Barbara County.",87,16.0,California
60933,Austria,"This is an attractively perfumed wine that's refreshing with lemon and apricot flavors. It has a zesty character with the crisp texture of apple skins. It's ready to drink now, but could also improve with age for three years. Screwcap.",86,17.0,Niederösterreich
60934,US,"This shows the streamlined acidity and minerality of a fine coastal Chardonnay, as well as the dryness. But the ripeness is impressive, suggesting notes of Key lime pie, lemon meringue and ripe, sweet kiwi, with subtle oak influence. An impressive wine from start to finish.",94,45.0,California
60935,US,"The winery's widely available Willamette Valley blend is forward, open and easy-drinking, with chocolaty cherry fruit. It's a style that should have wide appeal—smooth, toasty, with plenty of tasty chocolate highlights.",89,35.0,Oregon
60936,US,"Sour berries hit the nose on the front end of this wine that also shows somewhat reductive aromas of teriyaki, beef char and dark chocolate. Rose buds and black cherry arise on the sip, as does a slightly sour, barnyard funk.",86,42.0,California
60937,US,"Fresh blueberry and blackberry juice aromas meet with pepper and pressed lavender on the nose of this sleek bottling by Michael Larner, one of the Ballard Canyon appellation's loudest proponents.

60938,US,"This Bordeaux-style blend—60% Cabernet Sauvignon, 34% Merlot and 6% Cab Franc—comes from Pepper Bridge, Seven Hills and McClellan vineyard fruit. Round and approachable, it puts the sweet and tangy flavors of cherry and berry front and center, yet has the structure to age for up to a decade. These are the oldest blocks of fruit that Saviah uses, and this, says winemaker Rich Funk, stands as the winery's signature wine.",91,32.0,Washington
60939,France,"There is something floral and tender, even creamy on the nose. The palate on the one side has a creamy apricot and peach aspect, on the other a totally taut and brisk lemon-lime streak. This makes for tension and interest. This is concentrated and exciting, dry and very, very enjoyable. Drink now through 2025.",93,37.0,Alsace
60940,Spain,"Almost volatile, but with reduced raisin below. If you are familiar with   hot-climate California Zinfandel, this is not unlike that. It has a vinegary attack and then a strange but limited sweetness lurking in the weeds. A   challenged wine.",83,10.0,Northern Spain
60941,France,"The name is spot-on for a wine with a pink-pearl color. It is gently fruity with soft red fruits and a touch of pepper. The aftertaste is crisp, clean and refreshing.",86,20.0,Provence
60942,US,"Floral and exotic, the tingling acidity in this wine is the standout, but it's equally buoyed by a mouth-filling texture adorned by a sensation of fresh-squeezed lime and grapefruit. Balanced, this lovely Napa Valley Sauvignon Blanc should convince one and all of the variety's regional merit.",91,35.0,California
60943,South Africa,"There's an herbal streak to the red currant and strawberry hull aromas on the nose of this wine, alongside additional hints of sweet smoke, cured meat and fennel fronds.

60945,US,"This value brand makes a number of West Coast Pinots, with mixed results. Here are very strong, dominating flavors of vanilla and breakfast tea, of the sort often associated with oak additions during the winemaking process. Don't look for any specific Willamette Valley character here. It's a light generic red, tasting mostly of vanilla.",85,15.0,Oregon
60946,US,"Nothing fancy about this dry, plummy wine, but it gets the job done. Shows ripe currant, tobacco and herb flavors wrapped into firm tannins.",84,15.0,California
60947,France,"The pale rosé color doesn't detract from this concentrated, ripe wine that offers yellow fruits, orange zest and spicy flavors. Pure acidity gives intense freshness and an impressive depth of flavor. The wine will be better after more aging, so drink from late 2016.",91,52.0,Provence
60948,US,"An apt name for this richly fruited and supple wine, which features high-toned green grass, stem and herb aromas over earthy, black-cherry flavors. The finish is long, spicy and briary. If you enjoy the herbal aspect of Pinot Noir, you may rate it even higher.",90,50.0,California

60950,US,"Fogarty's basic '05 Chard shows an exciting crispness and minerality that, good as it is, makes you long for the single-vineyard bottlings to come. There's an elegant angularity to the wine despite the succulent pineapples, kiwis and new oak, and a brisk acidity that makes it finish vibrantly clean.",90,28.0,California
60951,US,"A sound, everyday Merlot. It has ripe blackberry, cherry, currant and cola flavors, and feels smooth and rich in the mouth. Great job at this price.",85,10.0,California
60952,New Zealand,"This is a ripe, plump style of Sauvignon Blanc, delivering ripe fig and melon aromas and flavors. It's not the crispest version you'll ever find, but makes up for that in its generosity of flavor. Drink now.",87,13.0,Marlborough
60953,US,"Still young and not entirely pulled together, this is still showing some post-fermentation flavors of candied orange, with a somewhat grainy texture. It's off-dry, with the 3% residual sugar quite apparent.",87,16.0,Oregon
60954,Australia,"This winery has made a nice Sauvignon Blanc as far back as I can remember. The 2016 is a linear, precise example, tightly focused and crisp on the finish. The ample pineapple and grapefruit aromas and flavors are zesty and refreshing.",90,22.0,South Australia
60955,US,"Kevin Furtado is a sommelier in Vail who owns this brand. The grapes come from some of Bien Nacido's best blocks. The wine is exceptionally lush and complex, showing flashes of tropical fruits, honey and minerals, tightly wound together in a firm structure. A really fine Chardonnay that should hold for up to 6 years.",93,29.0,California
60956,US,"The dominant aromas are smoke, toast, and cinnamon, which ride over tart-cherry fruit.  Turns quite stemmy and tough on the finish.  Drink young--with a piece of rare beef to help tame the tannins.",84,35.0,New York
60957,Italy,"Aromas of plum, tilled soil, truffle, dark baking spice and a whiff of violet lead the nose. The medium-bodied, easygoing palate offers juicy black cherry, white pepper and clove framed in lithe tannins and lively acidity. Enjoy through 2018.",88,25.0,Tuscany
60958,Italy,"Ripe black-skinned berry, truffle, scorched soil, violet and a potpourri of kitchen spice are some of the aromas that emerge on this polished red. The smooth, delicious palate doles out juicy black cherry, black raspberry, licorice and chopped mint set in a framework of silky, supple tannins. Enjoy through 2018.",92,25.0,Tuscany
60959,US,"Baked mulberry, black cherry and brown spice lead into more nuanced notes of iron, turned earth and carpaccio meatiness on the nose of this blended bottling by Rick Longoria. Dark red-fruit flavors show on the sip, framed by a tannic tension that will steadily reveal more elements in years to come.",90,32.0,California
60960,Chile,"This straddles the fence between vegetal and citrusy, with both sides appearing on the nose. In the mouth, this is high-toned and piercing, with laser-beam acidity pushing passion fruit, grapefruit, green herb and melony flavors. On the finish, a wave of mild green settles in, while the feel is actually a touch creamy. Drink now.",88,12.0,Casablanca Valley
60961,US,"The fantastic nose pitches French toast together with Meyer lemon pith, crushed rock, struck match and a slight sour-cream element. This wine is immediately lively on the tongue, with lots of but not overdone acidity. Yeasty toast flavors are cut by lemon and poached pear on a racy and focused palate.",93,48.0,California
60962,Germany,"Light in body, shades of green plum and freshly cut grass lend freshness to riper flavors of apricot and honey in this off-dry Riesling. Fresh and fruity, it's sprightly on the palate, with wide appeal.",88,16.0,Rheingau

60965,US,"With a twist of mushroomy earth upon opening, this inexpensive Cabernet is strong, hearty and a bit thin on the finish—fine but not a standout.",82,14.0,California
60966,Argentina,"A rusty, translucent color announces a light body. Along the way, aromas of compost and leaves, red fruits and earth don't stir much interest. Meanwhile, light oak and stalky red-fruit flavors finish leafy.",83,25.0,Other
60967,France,"Aged for at least five years in the Lanson cellars before disgorgement, this is a blend of Grand Cru wines from the Côte des Blancs.

The acidity at the end is bright and refreshing.",93,125.0,Champagne

60969,France,"Bridgitte and her husband Eric took over her family property in 2009, in 2014 producing a spicy and fruity wine. It has fine tannins and sweet red-berry fruit.

60970,Italy,"Aromas of black-skinned berry and exotic spice set the tone on this blend of Corvina, Corvinone and Rondinella. The dense palate delivers ripe black cherry, clove and a touch of white pepper alongside smooth tannins. Enjoy through 2021.",88,20.0,Veneto
60971,US,"A beautifully accessible wine, polished, pretty and likeable now for its gentle texture and silky tannins. The sweet cherry and raspberry fruit is encircled with a coat of fancy smoked oak. Made from 100% Cabernet, the wine is balanced enough to gain bottle complexity for a decade.",92,48.0,California
60972,France,"This classy wine is rich, with its firm structure still intact. It has bold tannins, ripe blackberry fruit and bright acidity. Its concentration, together with its dry, tannic core, confirms that it will age further. Drink from 2020.",92,90.0,Bordeaux

60974,Chile,"Big, awkward aromas of red fruit and oak are followed by simple berry and plum flavors and even more overt oak. The finish is big and warm, while late in the game the wine turns tangy.

60978,US,"This wine doesn't hold back from the representative California-style on its rich and strong nose: candied apples, browned butter, vanilla candies, sea salt caramel, browned marshmallow, even some Olroso Sherry tones. Yet the palate brings it all into focus, with bitter peach skin, pithy lime and grippy apricot playing the foil to vanilla bean and butter. It's a bold yet expertly restrained wine.",92,40.0,California
60979,US,"This isn't particularly complex or ageable, but it is a good example of a ripe Pinot for drinking now, at a fair price. It's slightly honeyed with toasty oak and raspberry jam flavors, and brightened with crisp acidity.",86,20.0,California

60982,New Zealand,"This modest Pinot Noir is pale in color and light in body, but don't discount it. Pretty notes of strawberries are attractively underlined by hints of twigs and cocoa. It turns more cranberry-like and slightly astringent on the finish. Drink now.",86,19.0,Marlborough
60983,Spain,"This Garnacha-Carignan blend contains some Syrah as well and smells almost exclusively of clove and spice. On the palate, it's resiny and sticky, with overwrought clove and barrel spice flavors that dominate the finish.",84,13.0,Catalonia

60985,US,"A layered, somewhat delicate nose of rose petals, purple flowers, cola spice and raspberry-laced chocolate serves as the introduction to this bottling. Cherry, cranberry and raspberry emerge subtly on the sip, lifted by potpourri and sagebrush that fit into a chalky and tight structure. This will age very well.",92,42.0,California
60986,Australia,"You might not know it from the name, but this is a bit of a critter wine, as Bulldozer is a nickname for the hairy-nosed wombat. In any event, it's a step up from much of the competition, offering sturdy cassis flavors tinged with pepper and herbs and a clean, mouthwatering finish. Imported by MHW, Ltd.",86,12.0,South Australia

60988,US,"The fruit is sourced from multiple vineyards across the appellation, including Eastside Estate, a vineyard formerly known as 3 Starrs recently purchased by the producer.

60989,US,"There's no disrespect to say this Cabernet is fun to drink. It is, for the soft, charmingly interesting mouthfeel and rich, sweetly forward blackberry, cherry, chocolate, cassis, anise and oak flavors. Few Cabernets in the world get this ripe and exotic. Enjoy it now.",91,85.0,California

60992,France,"Like with so many rosés, the grapes were harvested in the early morning to bring in fruit at its freshest. The result, even with a rich wine like this, is a crisp, crackling character that gives life and poise. The aftertaste sings of acidity.",87,19.0,Provence

60995,US,"The aromas on this wine are surprisingly blue fruited for a Cabernet, followed by notes of herb, green pepper and spice. The flavors are lightly sweet, followed by a spice-filled finish. It's a straightforward quaffer that doesn't quite show its variety.",85,13.0,Washington
60996,France,"The equivalent of an alternative second wine from Château Pichon Baron (with Les Tourelles), Les Griffons is named after the statues of griffins that are in the chateau's courtyard. This is a structured wine, firmly tannic while already showing plenty of black currant fruitiness. Equal measures of Merlot and Cabernet balance the wine and give depth of flavor. It will develop soon and will be drinkable from 2017.",91,,Bordeaux
60997,US,"A hearty cradling of oak provides a tinge of vanilla sweetness here, before richer notions of apple pie and cinnamon tug at the wine's fuller-bodied core. It'll appeal to fans of this richer, riper style, while still finishing in a measure of acidity.",86,22.0,California
60998,France,"The flinty whiff of reduction still clings to this wine, marking it out for longevity. On the palate it's uncompromisingly dry and wonderfully bracing, with a tart, bright streak of lemon at its citric core. Lithe and slender, it delivers a clean finish.",89,18.0,Alsace

61004,US,"Demonstrating how this meandering region can express warmer-climate grapes from its inland corners, this bottling shows deep and precise aromas of black cherry, cola syrup and condensed violets. A firm structure restrains the ripe blueberry fruit, allowing the dark chocolate and mint elements to lift the palate.",92,,California
61005,US,"Slightly sweet flavors of concentrated strawberry preserves create a rather thick mouthfeel. It's a jammy style of Pinot, to be sure, but with just enough supporting acidity to keep it from crumbling under its own weight. Drink over the next two or three years.",88,40.0,Oregon
61006,US,"Best known for their red Bordeaux blend, Rubicon also produces small quantities of this Syrah, grown on the Rutherford estate. The wine is spectacular and immensely satisfying.

61011,Portugal,"This is a young-colored wine that has been wood aged to smooth out the natural fruitiness of the Merlot.

61012,US,"A blend of 47% Cabernet Sauvignon, 34% Merlot, 15% Cabernet Franc and 4% Malbec, this is supple and substantial, and it breathes lush notes of plum, cassis, black olive, raw wood and mineral, plus a dash of caramel.",91,30.0,Washington

61017,Chile,"Warm, loamy, baked berry and cherry scents are the lead aromas on this blend of Cabernet Sauvignon, Carmenère and Syrah that also brings a green character into play.

Edgy tannins, leftover grit and green notes conclude things.",88,29.0,Colchagua Valley
61018,Chile,"With full oak and pineapple aromas along with a big mouthful of spicy apple and pear fruit, this is no weakling. On the contrary, it's full and meaty, with a lot of texture and extract. The feel is healthy even if the acidity is on the low side. A very good wine to drink now; it probably won't age that well.",88,14.0,Central Valley

61023,France,"With its well-handled new wood treatment, this wine instead has gone for full-bodied richness.

In 2–3 years, this will be a wine for luxuriating.",90,,Bordeaux
61024,US,"Tight, acidic and dry in youth, this Pinot has a don't-drink-me-now austerity. It resists efforts to break it down at every point.

61061,US,"The vineyard is, of course, in Oakville, which makes you wonder why they put the generic Napa Valley on the label. The wine itself, which is 100% Cabernet Sauvignon, is very dry and tannic.

61113,France,"Bright, fresh strawberries combine with a hint of green herbs for an attractive nose. But the flavors of this 50-50 blend of Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot are less effusive. Still, it finishes lemony and tart, making it a fine summer sipper.",84,9.0,Bordeaux

61115,US,"Sauvignon Blanc has been a consistent performer for Hanna, usually yielding a rich, ripe wine with brisk acidity. The '11 is one of their best efforts. It's tart, clean and savory, with the pineapple, tangerine and Meyer lemon flavors touched with a slight sweetness.",87,19.0,California
61116,Chile,"Opens with hard, tight, rubbery aromas of black cherry and blackberry. The palate is deep and tannic, with a vise-like grip and dark, herbal flavors of cassis, plum and berry. The finish, not surprisingly, maintains the wine's dark, rubbery, pushy character.",88,29.0,Maipo Valley
61117,France,"94–96. Barrel sample. Intense black currant fruitiness makes this wine unabashedly forward. The palate bears weighty tannins behind that fruit, resulting in a wine that is already quite balanced and structured.",95,,Bordeaux

61124,US,"Baked black cherry and black plum meet with lots of crushed gravel and light fennel on the nose of this bottling that is all about fruit and earth, rather than herb and spice.

61127,US,"This is likely the last vintage from this vineyard, which the family winery seemingly mastered in this bottling.

Cassis and berry flavors settle with blackened toast and menthol. Drink this Bordeaux-style blend through 2019.",90,50.0,Mendoza Province
61131,Chile,"Full and concentrated but also a little flat and pruney. This wine pushes ripeness to the max level, and the result is a heavy, tannic Cab with a lot of power and flavors of prune, chocolate, molasses and fig. Thick and chunky on the finish, too.

61140,US,"Domaine Drouhin's reserve-level Chardonnay puts new oak flavors front and center but backs them up with ultraripe fruit.

61153,Italy,"Here's a blend of Montepulciano (75%) and Aglianico (25%) with big, ripe intensity and polished tannins. Aromas include sweet cherry, blueberry and spicy cinnamon or vanilla. It feels big and bold in the mouth and would make a statement with lamb or beef.",89,26.0,Southern Italy

61158,France,"A flinty nose of citrus purity hints that this still requires bottle age, but all the elements of a great wine are present. It offers a bundled concentration of flavor and fruit, and a straight backbone of acidity pervades everything with a sense of purity. Right now, fresh citrus notes of lemon pith, peel and flesh dominate aromatically, but this will blossom. There are already inklings of honey and orange in the background but only time will reveal what cabinet of wonders is hidden here. Drink 2017–2025.",93,55.0,Alsace
61159,Argentina,"Fairly smoky at first, with background aromas of varietally appropriate game, leather and animal.

61165,Chile,"It's nice to see an ever-increasing number of serviceable kosher wines like this one being made available to consumers from around the world. That said, this one isn't much more than adequate. There's a modest amount of cassis fruit dressed up with earthy chocolate and vaguely minty aromas, but it lacks depth. Still, it's better than the kosher stuff I remember from my friends' bar mitzvahs.",82,8.0,Maule Valley
61166,US,"A real dazzler in the mouth, offering complex tiers of cherries, raspberries, sweet vanilla, rose petals, cinnamon and clove and smoky sandalwood.

61167,US,"The fruit for this 100% varietal wine is sourced from Calistoga and Rutherford—a blend that yields a densely tannic, meaty palate that combines soy, cedar and pepper notes.

61168,US,"Ripe and luscious, this coats the mouth with a mélange of juicy apples and peaches. That initial hit is followed up with a wash of buttery, toasted nuts, and finally kissed away with a lick of wet stone. It's creamy and rich without ever being tiring.",93,29.0,Oregon
61169,US,"Volatile and showing some scents of glue, this hides its cherry fruit. It's drinkable, but for those with a high sensitivity to volatility it may be problematic.",83,22.0,Oregon
61170,US,"Juicy, sweet honeydew and green plum flavors are cut by shards of piercing lime and lemon in this ripe, light-footed Riesling. Medium-sweet in style, it's a keenly balanced single-vineyard bottling that should improve well through 2021.",89,25.0,New York

61173,US,"A mongrel blend of Syrah, Sangiovese, Grenache and Cabernet Franc, this fruity red has a sweet core of blueberry jam, round and forward and quite appealing.

61174,Australia,"On the nose, this wine shows typical Chardonnay aromas of peach, melon and citrus, all augmented by toast and vanilla from barrel aging. But on the palate, it displays a tight, rather lean framework; there's more citrus than stone fruit, finishing crisp rather than particularly rich or nuanced.",86,18.0,Victoria
61175,France,"Elegant as well as rich, this is a beautiful wine. It has great depth of flavor, the sweetest fruit, deliciously ripe. At the same time, the tannins are an underlying sustenance to the impressive ageworthiness.",95,120.0,Bordeaux
61176,US,"Starts off with strong aromas of wintergreen and cola, then settles down to display plenty of  roasted cherries and cedar-sarsaparilla notes. Seems a bit heavy, and a sharp edge of acidity doesn't offset a slight alcoholic burn, but the wine does boast plenty of flavor",84,22.0,California
61177,US,"Kudos to Derby for holding this Cabernet Franc-based blend back for so long before release. The years have mellowed it, giving it a soft, rounded quality. Drink now for the lush cherries and currants.",87,32.0,California

61181,US,"This Pinot Gris is fermented on the skins, then aged in neutral oak for a year-and-a-half. It's a dusty rose in hue, and its tart rhubarb fruit is speckled with peppery spice.

61338,US,"Intensely aromatic, this is Oregon Pinot at its most lush. Seductive scents lead into lengthy, balanced flavors of cherry and red plum, highlighted with green tea and tobacco notes.

61365,US,"A standout in a flight of pricier Chardonnays, this young wine is tight and focused, with a pretty toasty edge.

It's approachable now, but should age well through 2023.",90,,Stellenbosch

61382,France,"This wine is round and smooth, with attractive white-fruit flavors. The light acidity is more than compensated by the touch of toastiness and spice. With a juicy aftertaste, the wine is already very enjoyable.",88,19.0,Burgundy
61383,France,This ripe wine is still young. It has a taut texture that's dominated by the lively white fruit and crisp acidity. There's a mineral streak that cuts through the wine to give a steely texture that will soften over the next year. Drink from the end of 2018.,93,65.0,Champagne

61400,US,"You don't have to age this wine—Jarvis did it for you, holding it back more than five years before release, which is a very expensive proposition for a winery. It's a splendid Cabernet, with the tannins soft and velvety.

61410,US,"This red blend offers a nose of spiced wood, tobacco and pepper, and on the palate, light, simple flavors of red fruit and cigar box.

Nice with Indian, Chinese, Vietnamese fare.",88,20.0,California
61413,US,"This feels lush and important right out of the bottle, tantalizing with tart cherry, cola and persimmon flavors that are wrapped in acids and tannins. Give it up to six years, and enjoy. All of the fruit comes from the Foray Vineyard in the Green Valley.",92,40.0,California

61418,US,"This fruit did not attain full ripeness in 2011, at least as far as this single-vineyard bottling would suggest. It's thin in the mouth, with considerable herbal character. Though balanced in terms of tannin and acid, the finish feels dilute.",87,30.0,Washington
61419,Australia,"A blend of Grenache, Shiraz and Mourvèdre, this is much more firmly tannic and structured than most such Australian blends. Grilled meat, red plum, black tea and rose hip notes are crisp and firm on the palate. Drink 2015–2023, and possibly beyond that.",92,65.0,South Australia

61443,Germany,"Barely there whiffs of honey, cantaloupe and tangerine intensify on the palate of this bright, fruity wine. It's lip-smackingly plump in yellow plum and cherry flavors, but tows a precise line of acidity that's refreshing. Drink now through 2020.",88,11.0,Mosel
61444,US,"Everything about this wine screams for aging. It's tight in acids and tannins, and the fruitiness tastes young and jammy with waves of raspberries, cherries, red currants and mocha. By turns, it's sweet and bitter, but always succulent, and with a finish so long and spicy, it persists after a full minute.

Hold until 2018.",96,169.0,Tuscany
61463,Italy,"This is a blend of Nero d'Avola and Merlot in almost equal measures. The first varietal offers aromas of red fruit, wild fennel and pistachio. The second grape lends softness and bright cherry flavor. There's a touch of tar and graphite on the close.",88,29.0,Sicily & Sardinia

61551,Chile,"Briary red-fruit aromas are earthy and mellow, with notes of red-apple skin and raspberry. This is medium in body, fresh and feels good on the palate. Plum, raspberry and vanilla flavors are lightly herbal, while the finish is largely smooth and mild.",86,13.0,Maipo Valley
61552,Italy,"This extra brut is a quintessential Franciacorta, offering a fragrance of white and yellow flowers and a whiff of citrus. The palate delivers ripe Golden Delicious apple flavors, accented with hints of hazelnut, along with a creamy texture supported by crisp acidity.",90,25.0,Lombardy
61553,US,"An assortment of cocoa, medicine cabinet, dried herb, licorice and cherry aromas take the lead on this appealing wine. It's rich and silky in feel with generous chocolate, cherry and vanilla flavors followed by a tart finish.",91,32.0,Washington
61554,US,"Makes for nice drinking right now, because of the abundance of forward, jammy blackberry and cherry fruit. On the other hand, the tannins are considerable, and the acidity is evident, so it could age over the next six years.",90,55.0,California
61555,France,"La Carte is a small vineyard in Lugny, producing this delicious crisp fruit-driven wine. It is lively with acidity and ripe with peach and baked pear fruits. The texture is just enough to allow it to age, so drink from mid-2017.",88,20.0,Burgundy
61556,Germany,"Sweet and bracingly tart at the same time, with racy acidity framing sweet orange and lime flavors. Flourishes of bergamot and cinnamon add complexity on the nose and reprise on the long finish.",93,143.0,Mosel-Saar-Ruwer
61557,Spain,"Ripe but nuanced aromas of tobacco, fig, berry and cassis come in front of a crisp, lively, fresh palate. Flavors of reedy berry, herbs, minerally plum and red currant finish with herbal tomato hints, dry tannins and bright acidity. Drink through 2018.",90,30.0,Catalonia

61559,US,"A very nice wine that shows the smooth, complex tannin structure, ripe fruit and dry balance you'd want from a Napa Valley Cabernet Sauvignon. You'll like the blackberry, cherry and cedar flavors, enhanced by touches of dried herb and cocoa. Drink now–2015 for fruity freshness.",90,45.0,California
61560,US,"Concentrated hibiscus and rose petals are cut by an iron minerality and anise character on the nose of this wine that Greg Brewer and Steve Clifton make for a Japanese partner.

61561,US,"Sophisticated in every way, this engaging, complex effort begins with fresh apple fruit, then layers in lemon curd and sliced orange components. There's a touch of beeswax, and a creamy mouthfeel that stretches out the finish.",92,40.0,Oregon
61562,Spain,"Loamy berry and saucy notes make for a complex bouquet, while the mouthfeel on this Catalonian blend is smooth, round, precise and structured.

61563,US,"Ripe fruit, in the form of raspberries, cherries and figs, characterizes this luscious Pinot. But it has much more going for it than that. The tannins are rich and complex, the finish is dry and spicy, and the overall impression is of wine with a great pedigree. Drink over the next six years.",92,47.0,California
61564,US,"Way too sweet in ripe, jammy cherry-berry fruit and caramelized oak, resulting in a Cabernet that tastes like the wine equivalent of a granola candy bar. Fans of this sweet style will like it.",85,49.0,California
61565,Chile,"Licorice, blackberry, cassis and plum aromas are concentrated and fruity. This feels fresh, with choppy tartaric acidity creating high tones across the mouthfeel. Baked blackberry flavors are limited but good, while a jammy, black-fruit finish is smooth, with just enough bracing acidity.",88,17.0,Colchagua Valley
61566,US,"Sourced from a 2001 planting of Dijon clone 777 vines, this is a dry, slightly leathery wine with tight flavors of dried figs dusted with cocoa and coffee grounds. It shows moderate depth and length, and seems ready for near-term drinking.",88,45.0,Oregon
61567,Australia,"This is a full-bodied, lushly textured Chardonnay that manages to avoid the sensation of excess weight.

61574,US,"Made using grapes grown high in the Mayacamas Mountains, this is extremely concentrated in pineapple essence, peach custard and tropical fruit flavors. It's extravagant, with 50% new French oak playing a strong role in contributing notes of buttered toast, crème brûlée and butterscotch to the flavor profile.",90,55.0,California
61575,US,"This wine is tight and citrusy now, with a kick of acidity. It's elegantly structured, but not showing much generosity, despite a core of lemondrop candy, green apple and honeysuckle flavors. Give it a few years to develop.",90,75.0,California
61576,US,"The scent of apple blossoms perfume this round, richly structured wine, accentuating flavors of apple and pear on the palate. Touches of vanilla and cream add weight and mouthfeel, but the wine finishes crisp with lemony acidity and saline minerality.",87,18.0,New York
61577,Argentina,"Mocha and chocolate welcome you in, but once you get in there isn't much to taste. There's generic red fruit, spice and leather, but the wine seems acidified and on the razor's edge. Not overly generous and the mouthfeel is sheering.",84,13.0,Mendoza Province
61578,France,"Fruity and juicy, this showcases the accessibility of this estate, while also highlighting some of the tannic structure of its big brother, Léoville-Barton. There is a classic black-currant note that's balanced by the firm tannins of the vintage.",94,,Bordeaux
61579,US,"This six-year-old blend of 46% Syrah, 32% Cabernet Sauvignon and 22% Merlot is showing its age, with aromas of reduced cherry sauce, tar and cocoa dust. The rustic palate is full of leather, tobacco, dried cherries and dusty earth flavors. Still interesting, but drink up soon.",86,22.0,California
61580,US,"Everything tastes interventionist on this Chardonnay. The fruit is extracted in pineapple jam, the oak is strong, the wine went through malolactic fermentation, which gives it buttered toast flavors, and the acidity feels unnatural given the ripeness. Will satisfy fans of the New World style, but the wine, tasty as it is, lacks authenticity and balance.",86,38.0,California
61581,Chile,"Gritty, gaseous aromas are demanding. This SB offers up a citric, pulpy body and slightly bitter flavors of passion fruit, orange and tangerine. Citrus pith and related bitterness blend with citric acidity on the finish, but this wine is starting to fade.",87,20.0,Leyda Valley
61582,France,"Grown on hills overlooking the Mediterranean, this wine sings of sunshine and warm days. It is fruity, fatter than in some previous vintages although still with good acidity and a lively aftertaste.",86,14.0,Provence

61586,Chile,"Pricy for Chilean SB, but clean, good and spunky, with citrus, nettle and bell pepper on the nose. The palate is wet, fresh and snappy, and the flavors exhibit grassiness along with tropical fruit and lime. Cleansing and crisp on the finish, and ready to drink now.",88,20.0,San Antonio
61587,France,"Using grapes sourced from 102-year-old vines, this is superripe and concentrated. Yet despite its richness, it has tight acidity that meshes with plum and damson fruits. Age for at least five years.",91,,Burgundy
61588,France,"From a small appellation in the north of the Mâconnais, producing reds as well as whites, this is initially a mineral, citric wine, which broadens out with toast, fresh acidity and a good weight, with lychee and yellow fruits.",85,,Burgundy

61590,US,"This wine offers astounding quality for the price, a juicy expression of fruit and spice with a depth of firm resolved tannin, lively acidity and layers of black cherry and cola.

61591,US,"For those who enjoy substantial flavors of toasty oak with their Chardonnays, this is a good choice. Full-bodied and instantly appealing, it's got ripe fruit flavors of peach, banana and apricot, underscored with green apple acidity. The toastiness comes through in the finish, with a lick of salted caramel tickling the back of the throat.",90,45.0,Oregon
61592,Argentina,"Jammy, scratchy, oddly spiced aromas set up a drawing, cloying palate feel. Gummy strawberry and raspberry flavors finish short and briny, with a sweet, chocolaty note.",81,15.0,Mendoza Province
61593,US,"This bone-dry, steely-textured wine is crisp and bracing due to firm acidity, fruity-but-not-sweet flavors and maybe a touch of tannin that adds to the firm mouthfeel. Like a squeeze of lemon on the pan-roasted fish, it will make a great counterpoint to lots of things on the menu.",91,30.0,California
61594,France,"Strong wood aromas lead to a wine that is still very young. The smoky wood character dominates the red berry fruits and typical acidity of the vintage. It does have the weight to develop well, so give this structured wine until 2017.",87,,Bordeaux
61595,US,"Chocolate and raspberry join forces in this jammy, soft and round wine that's sizable yet approachable. This is a good go-to for midweek meals and parties, with a medium body and respectable finish that will pair with a wide range of foods.",87,19.0,California
61596,France,"This is a full-bodied wine, from one of the leading estates in Margaux. It is ripe with juicy blackberry and black-currant fruits.

61597,US,"An intriguing combination of almost equal parts Malbec, Mourvèdre and Petit Verdot, Rock Wall's Romancer hails from Clarksburg's small Heringer Vineyard, and is bright, fruity and juicy with blackberry and strawberry flavors.

61605,France,"Bridgitte and her husband Eric took over her family property in 2009, in 2014 producing a spicy and fruity wine. It has fine tannins and sweet red-berry fruit. The acidity and the balance are just right. Drink this attractive wine from 2018. They donate one percent of their turnover to an environmental charity and are (they say) one of only two wineries in the world who are members of “1% for the planet.”",88,13.0,Bordeaux
61606,US,"Lots to like in this 100% Cabernet. It's rich in red and black currants, cassis and chocolate flavors and fully dry, with a fine minerality that adds to the structure. But the alcohol is on the high side, and it feels too soft for balance. Drink soon.",86,60.0,California
61607,US,"This is a rather austere, tough Chardonnay. Bone dry, it's marked by brisk acidity, minerality and citrus flavors, with a touch of apricot that's reminiscent of botrytis.",87,30.0,California
61608,US,"Three quarters Merlot, with 17% Cabernet Franc and 8% Cabernet Sauvignon, this is a bit lighter than the 2007 Merlot, but just as good, if not better.

61609,US,"Subtle aromatics and a zing of acidity lift this steely, medium-bodied wine, buoyed by streaks of fresh-squeezed lemon and grapefruit. The majority of the grapes come from Alexander Valley, with additional components from Sonoma Valley and Knights Valley. Aging was done entirely in stainless steel.",88,16.0,California
61610,South Africa,"This is the midrange wine in Danie de Wet's clutch ofChardonnays, proof that the hot climate of Robertson is no bar to making fine white wines. With its steely character, this is the most French wine, almost Chablis in style, from this producer. Spices, green plums, kiwifruit are all there, as is fresh, crisp acidity.",90,20.0,Robertson
61611,Germany,"Slightly savory, subdued apple and nut tones on the nose belie the intensity of fruit, mineral and earth ntoes that collide on the palate in this Kabinett. Green apple and lime flavors pierce the midpalate, catapulted by struck slate mineral notes and acidity. There's so much development to look forward to in this wine. Hold until 2020.",92,34.0,Mosel
61612,US,"One hundred percent varietal, this wine is a blend of fruit from Quintessence (69%), Fidelitas Estate, Canyons and Red Heaven Vineyards.

61614,France,"This ripe, full-bodied wine is full of lemon, apricot and crisp pear flavors. They are held together by the tight, almost steely edge to the young texture. It is a wine to hold for maybe a year and drink from 2017.",89,40.0,Loire Valley
61615,US,"Thick and dense in oak, this is a basic and generic version of the variety. Medium in weight it hints at elements of forest floor, tea and black cherry fruit.",85,20.0,California
61616,US,"Spring Valley wines have never been shy and retiring, but here the alcohol – 15.2% – seems to quickly mute the textural subtleties. Though it suggests a panoply of red and black fruits in the nose, the palate is a wash of coffee, toast, tannin and alcohol. The flavors get muddy and the alcohol strips the wine of its terroir.",87,50.0,Washington
61617,Spain,"Opens with sweet fruit aromas, a whiff of oak and red candy, while the mouthfeeel is juicy and mostly fresh, with clean fruit flavors and more than adequate ripeness and sweetness. Fresh, composed and pleasant in the scheme of things.",87,22.0,Northern Spain
61618,US,"The Sullivan designate mixes Pommard, Wädenswil and Dijon 777 clones, which were aged 10 months in 30% new French oak. It's similar to the winery's Dardis bottling in terms of the balance between fruit and herbs, though here there is a bit of a hole in the midpalate. Otherwise, it's a friendly mix of black cherry, cola and chocolate: forward and open.",89,52.0,Oregon

61620,US,"The production of Long Haul has doubled in 2010, and vineyard sources have changed, though most remain on Red Mountain despite the Columbia Valley appellation. The Bordeaux-style blend is 61% Merlot, 16% Cabernet Sauvignon, 12% Cabernet Franc, 9% Malbec and 2% Petit Verdot. It has drying tannins that somewhat mask the tart berry fruit. There's more stem and earth apparent in the palate, perhaps due to the addition of Cabernet Sauvignon. It's quite Bordeaux-like, in style and finish.",90,48.0,Washington
61621,US,"This wine's Honeycrisp apple and Applejacks cereal scents lead the nose before bold layers of luxurious texture confirm its complexity and overall appeal on the palate. Densely packed with flavor, it also shows plenty of structure to support its powerful range.",94,44.0,California

61623,France,"With a density of nearly 7,000 vines per acre, and consequent low yields, it is not surprising this is a concentrated, intense wine.

61625,US,"Tough and chewy now, with a fibrous, tannic mouthfeel like a bite of beef jerky. Similar flavors, too, of teriaki beef, but the underlying fruit is massive, offering waves of cherries, black raspberries, currants and cola. This is a very fine wine, but an immature one. Give it 4–6 years in the cellar, if you can keep your hands off.",92,54.0,California
61626,France,"This bio wine comes from just over one acre of vines in the appellation's best iron-red terroir. It is ripe and creamy, full of smooth apple-purée fruitiness. A good squeeze of lemon juice gives the wine its crisp aftertaste. Drink now.",88,48.0,Burgundy
61627,Chile,"Nice and ripe, with light whiffs of olive and herbs and strong berry fruit aromas. The palate is pure Maipo, meaning it blends herbal notes with black fruits, especially cassis. Firm in structure, stout on the finish, and ends with a hint of chocolate.",88,12.0,Maipo Valley
61628,France,"This pale copper rosé is made from 30% Grenache Gris, 30% Grenache Noir, 30% Merlot and 10% Cabernet Franc.

61629,US,"This blend of Cabernet Sauvignon (34%), Merlot (33%), Cabernet Franc (17%) and Petit Verdot brings vanilla, baker's chocolate, woodspice, dried herb and cherry aromas. It's medium bodied on the palate, with cherry flavors and cinnamon accents throughout.",88,30.0,Washington
61630,US,"Give this Cab extra points for the dazzle factor. It shows the most beautifully ripe flavors of blackberries and cassis, and a powerful but tasty coating of smoky oak. The tannins are so sweet and fine, but the excessive softness robs the wine of structure.",88,95.0,California
61631,France,"Although it is relatively soft, this wine still has everything about it. There is ripeness, but it is balanced with fresh acidity still with an aura of youth. In the core, there are solid blackcurrants, structure. It will certainly age, but drink over 10 years.",92,56.0,Bordeaux
61632,US,"Though labeled Riesling, it's blended with 16% Muscat and 9% Gewürztraminer. The residual sugar is listed as 2%, but rather than sweetness, the wine carries a sour lemon snap and a palate of tart citrus and orange soda flavors.",85,15.0,Washington
61633,France,"With its classic mineral edge, dusty tannins and firm, dry structure, the wine has a core that weighs well with the severe texture. As a contrast, the fruit underneath is ripe and juicy. A wine for several years' aging.",93,100.0,Bordeaux
61634,France,The wine is ripe and full of blackberry fruits. It has serious tannins still although these are well balanced by the fruitiness. The firm structure and wood aging flavor will soften over the next few years. Drink from 2020.,91,39.0,Bordeaux

61641,Germany,"Hints of smoke, crushed mineral and pollen lend an earthen dimension to pristine white grapefruit and tangerine in this elegant off-dry Riesling.

Oak adds the usual rich notes of vanilla and caramel cream. Not particularly subtle, but decadent and delicious.",90,45.0,California
61644,Argentina,"Crisp up front, but not overly aromatic or fruity. Feels kind of thick and chewy, with gummy, sweet berry flavors that suggest cherry and plum. Feels a little cloying and cooked on the finish, especially for a young 2011.",84,13.0,Mendoza Province

61648,US,"Whiffs of ripe black cherries, vanilla and spice, along with delicate hints of soil and barnyard, mark this unusual blend of Saperavi and Sereksiya grapes.

61654,France,"Foursquare, almost chunky, the tannins dominate black fruits, dark chocolate and spice flavors. There is considerable concentration here, along with initial high acidity.

61659,US,"The best blend from JM Cellars is Tre Fanciulli, here composed of 67% Cabernet Sauvignon, 19% Merlot, and 14% Syrah.

61667,US,"This is soft, forward and fruity, with a somewhat flat mouthfeel. Soft, buttery oak rounds out into a smooth, silky finsh. Very seductive and caramel flavored, long, satiny finish. A drink-now bottle, not for aging.",89,28.0,Oregon
61668,US,"Made using 50% Barbera and 50% Alicante Bouschet, this wine is fragrant and full-bodied, with notes of toasty oak and leather.

61681,US,"The gentle touch of the winemaker is clearly visible in this soft but substantial effort. Light cherry fruit, a streak of mocha and a hint of hazelnut combine gracefully.

61690,US,"This red-label cuvée is made exclusively from estate-grown fruit. Lively and aromatic, it carries a streak of beetroot threaded through blackberry fruit.

The concentration is impressive, and the flavors continue on through a lengthy finish, with a suggestion of gunmetal as it subsides.",91,38.0,Oregon
61691,Chile,"On the nose, there are cider, oak and baked corn notes. The palate is full of oak and resin flavors that prevent the fruit from emerging immediately. It tastes of hickory, apple and melon on the palate and finish.",86,22.0,Casablanca Valley

61707,US,"The Freestone Hill bottling is one of Dutton Goldfield's biggest and most powerful Pinot Noirs, and the '06 is nearly as stunning as the magnificent '05.

Terrific now, but the tannins will hold it for a decade.",94,58.0,California
61708,US,"Whiffs of smoke and herbs add complexity to this beautifully floral, fruity wine.

The long finish has a bristle of lemon-zest astringency.",90,14.0,New York
61709,US,"Here the dominant grape is Merlot, with smaller amounts of Syrah, Cab Franc, Cab Sauv and Petit Verdot.

61712,US,"Tight and tannic, this single-vineyard offering emphasizes flavors of herb, grass and green leaf. There's a hint of pale, generic red fruit, but it's more in the veggie camp—think rhubarb rather than raspberry. A hint of brown sugar rounds out the finish.",85,28.0,Oregon

61717,US,"This wine is a rarity for Washington in a number of ways. It's 100% varietal, comes from Golden Ridge Vineyard, and saw just 20% new French oak. It offers appealing, luscious raspberry compote and herb aromas and flavors backed by lightly grainy tannins.",91,35.0,Washington
61718,US,"Rich and flashy in blackberries, dark chocolate and cassis liqueur, this Cab feels fancy all the way through to the dry, spicy finish.

Yet it's really too soft and one-dimensional for anything beyond 3–4 years before the fruit dies.",87,50.0,California
61719,France,"Showing the ripe 2015 vintage, this is a soft rounded wine. It has attractive acidity to lift the ripe yellow fruit and add a shot of citrus. The wine needs another few months to settle in, so wait until summer 2017.",87,25.0,Burgundy

61737,US,"A new effort from DDO, this drops Domaine Drouhin from the name, and puts the vineyard name front and center. It's young and well-crafted, with strawberry and cherry fruit. The potential is evident for an impressive site once the vines get some age under them.",88,35.0,Oregon

61750,France,"This is a full and rounded Blanc de Blancs with Chardonnay fruitiness tempered by both bottle aging and the steely structure that lies in the background.

61888,France,"An attractive pale-salmon color, this 100% Cinsault rosé opens with soft scents of strawberry, pear, melon rind and earthy spice. The palate is lush, with fleshy fruit flavors that are balanced by ample acidity and a soft tannic astringency on the close.",86,9.0,Languedoc-Roussillon

61891,US,"This vineyard-designated wine includes 13% Cabernet Sauvignon and 9% Syrah. The Syrah component seems to take over, in the form of tart berry, herb and dried leaf flavors. The alcohol, which is 15.5%, mutes any other complexities. It's a nice wine, but it doesn't offer standard Washington Merlot flavors.",88,28.0,Washington

Cedar and graphite season it well, as firm, thick tannins fill up the finish.",90,125.0,California
61900,US,"The alcohol on this bottling is lower than most Fe Ciegas have been in the past, reflecting the cool vintage. The wine seems more austere than in the past, withholding a bit of the early appeal it used to show. Nonetheless, it's wonderfully structured in acids and tannins and very dry, with a judicious application of oak, and there are intricate flavors of cherries, red currants and herbs. Seems like it could shine with age, so give it six years in the cellar.",92,48.0,California
61901,US,"The estate-grown, Dijon clone fruit is bursting with flavors of grapefruit, pineapple and Meyer lemon. Barrel fermentation rounds it out a bit and adds suggestions of nut oil to the finish. The relatively low alcohol keeps the acids up and suggests that this is one that could age well up to 2025.",91,50.0,Oregon

61910,US,"Plenty of flavor in this extremely ripe wine. Bursting with blackberry and cherry pie filling, currant, chocolate and cedar flavors, it's clearly delicious. Yet it's a very soft wine.

61913,France,"A perfumed note of citrus peel and soft pine create a bracing nose that nonetheless suggests ripeness. The body is lithe and light, with a backdrop of stone and subtle nuttiness. With a little more air, the characteristic notes of mature Riesling appear: some lifted chamomile and candied orange peel, but only in their early stages. This is a wine of immense depth and deceptive lightness that has years of life ahead. Drink through 2030.",95,60.0,Alsace
61914,US,"While sultry and rich with ripe black-fruit flavors, this concentrated Pinot Noir is surprisingly multidimensional on the nose and palate. Green herb and brisk acidity add freshness.

61917,Spain,"Jammy but generic berry fruit aromas are crowded by lactic, pasty oak scents and vanilla. The wine is hard as cement in the mouth, with jagged tannins.

61928,New Zealand,"At this early stage, the oak is still prominent. Mocha and brown sugar mark the nose, the palate offers dark-roasted coffee bean notes and the finish seems rather dry and astringent.

61986,US,"Made from grapes grown in a coastal, cool-climate vineyard, this Chardonnay is gracefully minerally and acidic. It has all the tart, wet-stone tang you could want, along with intense quince, golden mango and Asian pear fruitiness. This lovely wine is worth every cent of its price.",93,42.0,California
61987,US,"From R.H. Phillips, itÕs a shade oakier and more refined than their regular bottling. The peach flavors are more concentrated, and sappier, but it comes at the cost of crispness. The wine sags in the mouth, like a Dali melted watch. But it tastes good.",85,14.0,California
61988,US,"Made from estate-grown Dijon clones, this saw a touch of new oak. It's fruity and forward, as befits the ripe vintage, but stops short in the finish. There's also a light streak of vanilla and a suggestion of ginger.",86,20.0,Oregon

61994,US,"This is much creamier, with much more leesy flavor than the regular bottling, but not as much ripe fruit (perhaps because it is from a different vintage). Various flavors of nuts, honey, spice and light tropical fruit mingle in a well balanced finish.",89,15.0,Oregon
61995,US,"Ken Wright produces more than a dozen single-vineyard Pinots in any given vintage. This wine, which sells for a fraction of the cost of those wines, uses many of the same grapes. It's an astonishing value, lushly fruited, tangy and laced with appealing minerality. The mix of red fruits, earth, acid and mineral is a perfect encapsulation of the pricier cuvées' strengths.",91,25.0,Oregon
61996,Chile,"This cool-vintage Cabernet is a bit grassy and herbal on the nose, with standard berry aromas lurking in the backdrop.

But it has a candied one-dimensionality, and doesn't seem likely to age.",85,50.0,California
62039,France,"This classed growth is taking on a new life after years of not achieving its potential.

62057,US,"A five-grape, Bordeaux-style blend, this young wine is still pulling itself together, but already shows ripe, substantial, nicely textured components. The crisp black fruits are etched with ripe tannins, and aging in 75% new French oak adds chocolate and espresso tones.",92,36.0,Oregon

62073,South Africa,"Brims with dark fruit notes of mulled boysenberry, cassis and black cherry, all streaked with spicy accents of menthol and black tea leaves.

62079,US,"You'll want to cellar this one, because it's tight and hard in tannins, as befits a well-made Diamond Mountain Cabernet. Entirely dry, it has a strong heart of cassis. But the structure is impeccable, and all it needs is time. Best after 2011 and probably well beyond.",92,65.0,California

62089,US,"A blend of several vineyards, this was aged for 17 months in French oak. The barrel influence is subtle, but the time in wood has helped to round out the tannins.

62312,US,"Syrah is a core strength of Darby, and as with previous vintages, this is dense and aromatic, leading from floral scents into a dark, almost broodingly deep core of blackberries, cassis and pepper. Full-bodied and 14.4% alcohol, this captures the essential strengths of Washington Syrah, done as a fruit-driven, berry-laden style.",92,25.0,Washington
62313,France,"This wine is full in the mouth with a taste between pepper and fruit. It's ripe, rounded and tangy with clementine zest as well crisp apples and red currants. It could benefit from a few months in bottle, so drink from late 2015.",91,25.0,Provence
62314,Chile,"Aromas of graphite, chocolate, olive, herbs and berry fruits open this cool-climate Syrah. Laser-beam acidity comes on like gangbusters, while those sharp acids create racy, almost tart flavors of currant and huckleberry. The finish is more flashy and racy than generous and tasty, and thus crispness is the defining character of this wine.",88,43.0,San Antonio
62315,US,"The blend on this complex red wine is mainly Cabernet Sauvignon, with some Petit Verdot and what the winery calls “other reds.” It's the most interesting of Geyser Peak's 2011s, showing ripe, forward black cherry and red currant fruit, but also notes of dried herbs, minerals, bacon, black pepper, licorice and espresso. While it's not an ager, it grows more interesting as it breathes in the glass.",91,28.0,California

62317,US,"This wine pulls it all together for a full-bodied, full-flavored and well-balanced taste experience. It smells like fresh-cut oak in a good way, tastes ripe and fruity, yet at the same time is somewhat tart and dry like cranberry juice. It's rich, well made and could even improve through 2020.",91,20.0,California
62318,US,"From a range of vineyards including Cole and Rodgers Creek, this blend is thick and soft, highlighted in charcuterie, black licorice and tar aromas. Birch and leather add more savory personality, as the nose continues to suggest the aromatic landscape of an Italian deli. It's cofermented with a small percentage of Viognier.",92,40.0,California
62319,US,"The first thing you notice is the complexity of flavor, carrying waves of wild forest raspberries and cherries, framboise and other liqueury, extracted tastes, sprinkled with rose petal, Dr. Pepper cola and exotic spices, and rounded off with smoky sandalwood. Then the tannins and acids kick in, emphasizing extreme dryness. There are dozens of Pinot Noirs that are more drinkable now, but this is such an interesting interpretation that it deserves a place in your cellar. Try after 2013.",94,100.0,California
62320,France,"Expanding on their fathers' legacies, the cousins Jean-Laurent and Jean-Dominique Vacheron have a deserving reputation for their almost-Burgundian Sancerre. This latest vintage, packed with both fruit and structure, shows why. It is ripe with red cherries and dark plums laced with acidity. The wine is full of great ripe fruit and generous tannins. Drink from 2018.",92,40.0,Loire Valley
62321,France,"With a sweet nose of honey, malt and Golden Delicious apples, this is a fairly weighty Chardonnay from an unheralded appellation. The slightly oily herb and peach flavors pick up more butterscotch on the finish, yet remain crisp and clean.",85,14.0,Burgundy
62322,US,"Organically grown grapes are put to fine use in this rich, crisp Chardonnay that is highly attuned with acidity. Pressed whole-cluster, the grapes yield a wine that tends toward sour green apple, balanced with a texture that lends it some heft.",87,20.0,California
62323,US,"This Chardonnay has depth, starting with its unfolding nose of ripe Chardonnay fruit, minerals, hazelnut and citrus. The palate offers flavors of pear, citrus and grapefruit, its character refreshing and fruity but somewhat complex. An impressive white that can handle richer dishes.",86,19.0,New York
62324,US,"This lovely wine has a great depth of decadent, succulent aromas of citrus and apple blossom, that explode around tangy acidity. Pear, quince and lemongrass-ginger spice dot the palate in measured, beautiful ways, finishing balanced and crisp.",91,45.0,California
62325,US,"Lovely honeysuckle and apple blossoms lead into lush flavors of gooseberry jam, lemon curd and apple butter; the mind reels at the complexity.

62329,US,"There is so much wood on the nose of this bottling that it smells like an oak stave mill, with shaved cedar and maduro cigar touches dominating the black-currant and elderberry fruit.

62335,US,"Fresh-pressed alpine strawberries and blackberries are lifted by touches of cola and fresh lilac on this wine by retired baseball pros Rich Aurilia and Dave Roberts, today the Dodgers' manager.

62336,France,A beautiful wine that has plenty of weight and also a firm structure of minerality to go with the yellow fruits that are now evolving into more mature flavors. It is by no means at its peak yet. Give it 2–3 years.,92,70.0,Burgundy
62337,US,"The Fielding Hills Syrah remains one of my favorites in a state loaded with great Syrahs, fruit-powered with spicy purple fruits, annotated with scents of game, anise, smoke and moist earth. The black and purple fruits dominate, as expressive and ripe as any Syrah in the state. It's still young, a bit oaky, and relatively high in alcohol. Give it some bottle age and all the complexity will come into focus.",93,40.0,Washington
62338,US,"This is a good vintage for Handley's Mendocino blend, a mishmash from various vineyards throughout the county. The wine has structure and bright acidity, with its intensity tucked between its layers. This can likely age.",88,25.0,California
62339,France,"This is a dark, young-colored wine, its purple shade reflecting the dense wood and tannin-laden flavors. It has spice and some bitter extract but these are balanced by ripe blackberry fruits and a rich texture. Drink from 2017.",89,29.0,Bordeaux
62340,US,"The distinct black and white pepper nose on this wine by Siduri's Adam Lee evolves into gingerbread and cinnamon, all backed up by riper scents of blackberry extract.

62344,US,"Arger-Martucci hits bigtime with this Cabernet Franc-based Bordeaux-style blend. It marches in a different direction from the soft cult style, showing brisk acidity, hard tannins and relatively moderate alcohol.

62347,US,"A blend of mainly Merlot and Cabernet Sauvignon, with smaller amounts of other traditional Bordeaux varieties, this treads perilously close to being too ripe. It shows a hint of raisin, but not enough to interfere with the beauty of the blackberry jam and sweet oak flavors. The tannins are exquisite, in the way of a top Napa Cab.

62351,New Zealand,"This isn't as big and ripe as some earlier vintages, but it's still a bold expression of Gimblett Gravels Syrah.

Drink 2015–2022.",92,100.0,Hawke's Bay

62385,US,"This one has extreme funky, deep aromas of tree bark and barnyard. But those smells yield to friendly layers of black cherry, plum, coffee and kirsch.

62420,Chile,"A bit soupy to begin with; the nose is herbal and a touch brambly, with a certain grittiness. In the mouth, it's grabby and tannic, with full black cherry and blackberry flavors. Dark, toasty and charred as well, with more size than elegance. A good wine but nothing out of the ordinary.",86,17.0,Colchagua Valley

Cabernet has seldom seemed so pretty.",92,75.0,Washington
62424,US,"Coming from the highest corner of the limestone-laden vineyard at 1,275 feet—with views of the entire Santa Ynez Valley—this gives off broad, approachable aromas of lit match, bacon fat, purple fruits, pepper and smoked meats.

62429,Chile,"Baked apple, pulpy citrus and oak aromas create a soft nose. In the mouth, this feels wide and resiny, and the flavors match that lead: oak, resin, vanilla, tropical fruit and citrus are all registering. On the finish, this is oaky and resiny.",87,25.0,Casablanca Valley

62437,France,"This is a beautiful wine, full of ripe yellow fruits, steely acidity and a juicy character that comes from the apple and apricot fruit flavors.

62442,US,"Very fine, showing the class of this vineyard, at a great price.

The minerality reprises throughout, giving the wine a steely authority.",92,28.0,California

62446,US,"Topel uses the Syrah Noir clone that was originally sourced from M. Chapoutier to make this tasty wine. It's packed with spicy red fruit and smooth, silky tannins.

62461,US,"A blend of eight different Syrah clones and a splash of Grenache, this is dark and sappy, with dense veins of citrus oil, licorice, coffee liqueur and black tea that are anchored by a solid black-cherry flavor. This should drink well for a decade or longer.",91,32.0,Washington
62462,Chile,"Tarry, gritty, earthy aromas of tomato, herbs and cherry feed into a juicy, hard-driving, acidic palate. Flavors of boysenberry and tart currant finish peppery, with a hint of cocoa as well as modest heat and scour. This is racy and shows coastal brightness. Drink through 2017.",90,25.0,Leyda Valley
62463,US,"This is one of Lynmar's most expensive Chardonnays, of their six 2011s. It's also one of the most forward and oakiest. Your first impression is of sweet buttered toast, sprinkled with brown sugar and drizzled with melted butterscotch. Then the tropical fruits kick in, brightened with citrusy acids. It's an impressive feat, but the wine feels overworked, and lacks the sustaining interest of Lynmar's other bottlings.",88,70.0,California
62464,US,"Bold notions of strawberry and cherry form around a robust core of oak and tannin, giving this rounded, approachable wine a medium to full-figured build.

62465,US,"The storied Carneros producer dips a toe into Oregon with this new release. It's got ample herbal aromatics and bright, brambly berry fruit, with cinnamon-stick highlights.

62469,France,"Black-currant flavors are right up in the front of this wine. With some youthful stalkiness, it also has the potential for a really juicy character that is bright, almost crisp.

62470,US,"While demure on the nose, this dry Riesling offers a palate that is surprisingly bold in both flavor and textural intensity.

62472,US,"This spent 18 months in 100% new oak—rock star treatment for the winery's top cuvée. Toast, cherry pipe tobacco and spicy cherry cobbler flavors combine in a deep and potent wine that remains firmly tannic. Optimal drinking is 2018–2028.",93,65.0,Oregon
62473,Chile,"Horsey aromas infringe upon basic cherry and tomato scents. This is lean on the palate, with scouring acidity. Tart, spicy plum and cherry flavors end on a crisp, dilute finish with that reverberates with sour plum and cherry notes.",85,11.0,Chile
62474,France,"Produced from the oldest vines of the Domaine, the wine is taut while also ripe. It has a crisp edge along with hints of the year's wood aging. That adds spice and a peppery edge to the ripe yellow and golden-plum flavors. Drink from early 2018.",93,40.0,Loire Valley
62475,US,"This is showing an extraordinary amount of toasty oak in the nose, and once in the mouth it seems as if the oak and toast flavors overwhelm everything else. The fruit is very much on the light side, and can't begin to stand up to all the toast and butterscotch that is being tossed around. It's not bad, but it has not yet found its balance, and finishes with some lightly stemmy tannins.",84,23.0,Washington
62476,US,"Aromatically complex with hints of dusty compost, peat moss and coffee grounds, this moves gracefully into a lively palate. Orange and lemon peel, black tea and juicy acids highlight a red berry core. This is a totally gulpable and thoroughly delicious young Pinot.",90,20.0,Oregon
62477,Spain,"Sweet and sour aromas amount to a prickly bouquet, while the palate has some flesh as well as freshness. Nectarine and spiced apple flavors are solid but pithy, and overall the wine is good but lacks concentration. Good for everyday quaffing.",85,15.0,Northern Spain
62478,US,"Lightly chocolaty and herbal, the reserve is marginally fruitier than the regular 2005 Syrah, with the same mix of cherry tobacco and licorice. Tannins are chewy and quite dry.",82,17.0,Washington
62479,France,"Intense acidity gives this wine character. It is taut and nervy, with a mineral texture. The bright, crisp red-fruit background to this acidity will assert itself over the coming months. Drink from late summer 2017.",87,16.0,Bordeaux
62480,Israel,"This salmon-colored wine has a bouquet of pear, rose petal and lime zest. It is a little tart at first sip, but is ultimately well balanced and refreshing, with flavors of strawberry, peach and rose that lead to a lime sorbet finish.",87,20.0,Israel
62481,US,"Bergevin's Bordeaux blend is almost jet black in color, thick with liquorous candied cherry and coffee scents. It's mostly Wahluke Slope (Stone Tree vineyard) fruit, and has the power to show for it. Black fruits, tar, coffee liqueur, chocolate, whiffs of tobacco make for a complex and compact wine that will reward cellaring.",90,55.0,Washington
62482,US,"Cranberry, spice and fresh herb give this peppery Pinot plenty of flavor interest. Definitely on the earthy and herbal side, this juicy wine is a good go-to bottle for everyday drinking.",86,17.0,Oregon

62484,Argentina,"The difference between this and the brand new 2016 is obvious: this is maderized but still good. Aromas of orange blossom are floral, but overall this seems low on crispness.

62485,US,"This wine is made by UC-Santa Cruz astrophysics professor Joe Miller, who's taught wine appreciation for years. Regal and wondrous, the nose conveys concentrated lavender, violets, cedar, oregano, rose petals and patchouli spicing up a grapy frame. The palate offers red fruits laced with clove spice and earth.

62486,US,"This bottling from the family's estate vineyard in the Foxen Canyon area rides the gamy side of the grape, with sizzling lamb crust, rosemary, black pepper and lavender on the nose.

A touch of vanilla marks the finish.",93,49.0,California
62487,US,"The nose of this blend of 58% Syrah, 17% Cabernet Franc, 9% Merlot, 8% Malbec and 8% Petite Sirah is a touch funky, with sour blackberry, charcoal and dried meat aromas. Charred blueberry, sour black plum and savory meat flavors show on the palate.",86,32.0,California
62488,US,"The wine has lingering leather touches on the tongue and quite a lot of bitter tension throughout. Like many 2011s, it shows a tartness and grip that some may find pleasant, and others just challenging. Food seems a must for this wine, which comes out of Terravant Wine Company in Buellton; try fondue, salted meats, or aged cheese.",84,23.0,California
62489,US,"Half Malbec and half Petit Verdot, the barrel notes of vanilla and pencil lead play off cherry and purple flowers with citrusy acidity and firm, dry tannins providing the frame.",88,34.0,Washington
62490,France,"Produced exclusively from Grand Cru vineyards in the Côte des Blancs, this is a beautiful, dry wine. It has a chalky texture and ample acidity that frames the tight fruit.

62491,Australia,"The centerpiece of Phil Sexton's current venture (he previously founded and sold both a brewery and a winery) is this single vineyard, from which he makes a Pinot Noir and this wine.

62517,US,"Leonetti's 2009 Reserve—92% Cabernet Sauvignon and 8% Merlot—is a simpler blend than in past vintages, and it seems to mark a return to the style of wine that built the winery's reputation initially. Powerfully, lavishly oaky, with a ripe, chewy black-fruit flavor, it is bursting with notes of black cherry, cassis, dark chocolate and a hint of butter. Though not quite as graceful or detailed as the regular Cabernet, this is the more potently expressive of the two flagship Leonetti reds.",94,140.0,Washington
62518,France,"A wine that goes straight into currants along with more exotic fruit like mango. That makes it rich in taste, as well as soft in texture. The acidity is there, but seems almost incidental, lost in the vivid fruits.",89,,Loire Valley
62519,France,"Using fruit that was sourced from a 12-acre property planted to Merlot, this wine is laden with wood. A burnt edge covers what will inevitably be attractive, ripe plum fruit. It has acidity on the finish, and its juicy element promises good things in 2–3 years.",86,22.0,Bordeaux

62521,Chile,"Candied but also peppery and herbal, and without much depth or complexity. The palate is tight, acidic, sheering and tastes of snappy, edgy cherry and raspberry fruit. Then an oaky, vanilla dryness sets in. Solid and fresh, but hardly a head-turner.",85,16.0,Casablanca Valley

62524,France,"94-96 Barrel sample. A beautiful wine, with its fresh wood, lively blackcurrant juice flavors, and subtle tannins. It has a lift and liveliness to it, which sits easily over the firm structure.",95,,Bordeaux
62525,Italy,"Aromas of underbrush, stewed prune and baking spice waft out of the glass. The smooth, enveloping palate doles out dried black cherry, raspberry jam, pipe tobacco and cinnamon framed in velvety tannins that lend polished support. A cocoa note closes the finish.",93,94.0,Veneto

62527,Spain,"This blend of Garnacha, Marsellan and Syrah opens with a dark, inky, smoky nose that's full of lemony oak along with black-fruit aromas.

62528,Chile,"Boysenberry, cassis and baked plum aromas give this a berry driven outlook. The palate is thick and saturated but well balanced, with blackberry, cassis, tea and herbal flavors.

62534,US,"Ripe, sun-kissed plum and blackberry flavors are crisply balanced in this juicy, velvet-textured red.

62536,France,"The steep slopes of the Monts Damnés are some of the best known in Sancerre.

62537,Macedonia,"This Merlot-Cabernet-Vranec blend offers an appealing, easydrinking array of warming spice, dark berries and spice on the nose and palate. Full in the mouth with a fruity character backed by acid and spice, it will pair well with veal or pork.",86,16.0,Tikves

Easy to find, with 10,600 cases produced.",92,24.0,California
62540,US,"A good, sound Cabernet, well-made and clean, with proper varietal flavors of blackberries, cocoa and smoky new oak. Yet it's somewhat soft, with a jammy-candy taste, and seems to lack complexity. Could be going through an awkward phase.",86,60.0,California

62544,France,"A rich, chocolaty wine, with the structure right up front.

62546,US,"Delicate swathes of honey brighten savory chestnut, smoke and mineral tones throughout this feather-light dry Riesling. It's an earthier slightly darker expression of Riesling with electric acidity accenting hints of spice and dusty pollen. The finish is long and intently smoky.",89,22.0,New York

62548,Israel,"With 18 months spent in oak, the wood influence is certainly apparent, but it's balanced by the deep black plum and cherry notes.

Intense notes of cigar box spice, black pepper, cedar bark and cocoa powder all abound in the bouquet and follow through all the way to the long close.

62559,US,"Flashy and opulent in style, this Chardonnay is full of ripe apricot, Meyer lemon, white peach and oak flavors.

62566,US,"A tremendous Syrah, so rich and tasty, it makes you wonder why more people don't drink this variety.

Dramatic and lush, this single-vineyard Syrah will provide good drinking over the next four years.",93,47.0,California

62574,France,"The chateau owes its name to the 18th-century Joseph Laffitte who created the estate. The wine ,which comes from the heart of Saint-Estèphe, is ripe with spice.

62581,France,This wine is fruity and crisp. It is also full of ripe apple and rich pear fruits that give density and fine concentration to this delicious impressive wine. The acidity adds brightness while the minerality comes from the taut steely texture. Drink this wine now.,90,50.0,Loire Valley

62585,US,"Wow. Black Kite's River Turn, one of of its three annual block designates, is invigoratingly inviting, a heady mix of floral cherry pie, bright, full and ripe with a balanced backbone of acidity and a gentle hint of gingerbread. This wine is ready to enjoy this second, but if you can help yourself, it'll also hold up for several years in the cellar and no matter when you decide to drink it, pair exquisitely with a range of deftly mannered food.",95,55.0,California
62586,France,"Still firm and tannic, this dense wine will need some time to develop. It has dark tannins and concentrated red-plum and berry flavors. A smoky background from the wood aging will soften over the next year. However with the tannins, the wine should not be drunk before 2020.",92,70.0,Burgundy

62589,Argentina,"In an attempt to ramp things up, Rutini has a wine that's loaded with candied black fruit, tire rubber and a distinct green streak. The palate is all blueberry and sweetness, but it's short, green and terribly basic. And the feel and finish are narrow and scratchy, respectively. Not one of Rutini's better efforts.",83,20.0,Mendoza Province
62590,US,"Mandarin-orange zest, cut Asian pear, lemon blossom and slight beeswax show on the fresh nose of this bottling by young winemaker Mike Callahan. It's extremely dry on the palate, like licking limestone, with hints of nectarine blossom and lemon-skin flavor.",90,22.0,California

62599,Chile,"Enclave is Ventisquero Winemaker Felipe Tosso's collaboration with John Duval from Australia.

62600,France,"As with so many wines from Blaye, this is dominated by Merlot. That gives a ripe full wine that is spicy and full of black-plum fruits. Firm tannins still show through the fruits that are balanced by acidity. The wine still needs to age, so drink from 2018.",86,28.0,Bordeaux

62603,US,"This blend of many vineyard lots seems less than the sum of its parts. Pungently herbal with characteristic Oregon tomato leaf tannins, its fruit remains hidden beneath the tannins. Age may enhance its beauty, but for the moment it remains tight and unyielding, with suggestions of heat around the cranberry/pomegranate fruit.",86,45.0,Oregon
62604,US,"A nod to the winery's co-owner Judge Royce Lewellen, this bottling is full of campfire smoke, red cherry, hibiscus and roasted pork aromas.

62606,US,"The “Essence” in the designation refers to the wine's sources, which are selected blocks from the winery's vineyards in the southern part of Napa. The wine is absolutely dry, mouthwatering in acidity, and vastly complex. There's a touch of smoky, vanilla-scented French oak, but the fruit flavors star. They suggest stone-driven minerals, Meyer lemons, limes, white peaches, pink grapefruits and a savory, umami-rich note of figs. The wine is ideal now and should evolve for many years.",95,50.0,California

The palate has wintergreen along with solid black cherry flavors, while accents of pepper and licorice give it a dark side. Finishes a bit grating and tannic, with espresso-like bitterness.

Best from 2025 to 2035.",94,99.0,Washington

62638,US,"This 100% Cabernet deserves its reserve status. Compared to the regular 2011, it's richer, with a smoothly tannic mouthfeel framing blackberry, black currant and cedar flavors. It will hold in the bottle until 2018, but there's no reason not to pop the cork now.",90,50.0,California

62645,US,"Sourced from estate vines planted in 1972, this is historic, yet not quite as rich in the details that some newer Pinot clones might provide.

62664,US,"Jax has struggled to find a style to their Chardonnay. This 2011 is their finest effort to date, although it does show the effects of the chilly vintage, being tight and tart.

62671,US,"Very rich and flamboyant, this could only have grown in a New World climate. In fact it's from a coastal vineyard.

62677,US,"Shows Pride's house style, a wildly bold, mountain-concentrated wine that couldn't possibly be fruitier or riper.

62681,US,"Light and reserved on the nose, this bottling by regional legend Adam LaZarre shows chipped slate, lemon rinds and apple flesh on the nose.

62682,Chile,"Priced just above the Best Buy level, Quatro is still a great value. MontGras brings Cabernet, Malbec, Carmenère and Syrah together in a well-meshed way.

62683,US,"This is a very good example of an unoaked Chardonnay. It has lots of zingy fresh-fruit aromas, lively citrus and green-apple flavors and good supportive acidity to keep the mouthfeel tangy. Winemaker Karl Wente made this one to please his no-frills dad, Eric Wente.",90,30.0,California

62685,US,"One of this historic winery's top bottlings, this wine shows aromas of mushrooms, turned earth, wet gravel, chipped slate and rich raspberry syrup.

62708,US,"This pretty light pink wine's acidic bounty is apparent on first sniff, as the underripe raspberry aromas are cut by a baking soda-like freshness.

62851,US,"Coming from the warm 2013 vintage, this is an aromatic offering, with notes of pineapple, kiwi, herbs and oak spices (40% barrel fermented). It's creamy in feel, but with tart, vibrant acidity that keeps the palate fresh and lively.",90,15.0,Washington

This is a wine that is still young, still smoothing out its hard edges.",91,47.0,Burgundy
62854,US,"The winery made its bones with its fabulous Sacrashe Cabernet from Rutherford. This is their first release from Diamond Mountain, and the result is quite interesting. In fact, it's very good, but disappointing, considering the price. The wine is firm and hard in tannins, with blackberry, currant and new oak flavors, yet it's a little lacking in depth. Could be an ager, but don't bet the farm.",87,100.0,California
62855,Italy,"Fragrant and savory, this opens with attractive aromas of crushed violet, iris, perfumed berry and a whiff of tilled soil.

62876,Germany,"If there is any criticism to be made of this wine, it might be that it is just too fruity.

62899,Argentina,"Not very vivid in color, with aromas of rhubarb, raspberry and red licorice candy.

62909,Spain,"Jammy black plum aromas are savory, leathery and funky, with rusticity. This feels stout and chunky, while condensed flavors of fig and prune are fully ripe. A savory but mild finish is round but missing some structural support. Drink now through 2018.",88,25.0,Catalonia
62910,US,"Father-and-son vintners Joe and Sam Miller consistently deliver solid wines, including this twist-top Merlot that's aged in 50% new French oak.

That pyrazine touch hits the palate, along with black pepper and dark chocolate spice, accenting the tangy red fruit.",90,35.0,California
62911,France,"A perfumed wine that smells and tastes mature. While it still has some sweet strawberry fruit, secondary flavors of coffee, toast and mature acidity dominate. It is not likely to improve much with further keeping, but is a delectable Pinot Noir now.",92,400.0,Burgundy

62929,Italy,"This is a modern Cabernet, with a velvety mouthfeel that is very satisfying and succulent to the end.

62956,US,"Shows the soft, sensual mouthfeel you want in a nice Merlot, like silk gliding across the tongue, and the cherry and herb flavors are just fine. Misses some depth and complexity, but it's an elegant, restaurant-style wine for the money.",87,21.0,California
62957,US,"The aromas bring plenty of appeal, with notes of coffee, herbs, vanilla and woodspice. However the concentration of the cherry flavors doesn't seem entirely there, tapering toward the finish where the oak takes over.",88,36.0,Washington
62958,US,"Good, but something of a letdown after the previous two vintages. Could it be the unusually chilly weather in 2011? The wine is delicately structured and dry, with crisp acidity framing subtle cherry and cranberry flavors. But it's a little lacking in depth. Drink now.",87,25.0,California
62959,US,"While this wine is clean and vibrant, it tastes off dry. With its honeyed finish and flavors of peach, nectarine and apricot jam, this is one of the most pleasant California Rieslings on the market. It's easy to drink with ham, sausage and slightly sweet Asian fare.",88,14.0,California
62960,Chile,"Dusty spice and resiny oak aromas sit on top of pedestrian apple, pear and melon notes. This Chardonnay from a complicated, rainy vintage feels round and chunky, and sort of oily. Oaky peach flavors finish with little but barrel spice.",86,20.0,Aconcagua Costa
62961,New Zealand,"A terrific value, this is one of the more forward Syrahs from Hawke's Bay's glorious 2013 vintage. It's on the full side of medium-bodied, with a slightly creamy texture and a crisp, softly dusty finish that underscores a mélange of pepper, clove, cinnamon, blueberries, raspberries and yellow-fleshed plums. Drink now–2023.",92,23.0,Hawke's Bay
62962,France,"Rich and full, the wood and yellow fruit flavors are well integrated with the ripe acidity. Generous as well as elegant, it's a wine to drink now.",88,25.0,Burgundy
62963,Argentina,"Minty, floral aromas veer toward darker notes of cola, forest floor and leather. The palate is medium-full, with grabby tannins and roasted flavors of blackberry mixed with herbs and spice. A regular, oaky style of Cabernet with a raw, grabby mouthfeel.",86,30.0,Mendoza Province
62964,Argentina,"Sharp and tight on the nose, and then it stays narrow and rather punishing on the palate. It's a tangy, gritty, tough wine with tart red-fruit flavors and bitter coffee note on the finish. Malbec-Syrah-Tempranillo is the blend.",82,,Mendoza Province
62965,US,"Rich, elaborate and layered. If this Cab were a fabric, it would be suede. Shows the tannins and minerals of Diamond Mountain, with potent flavors of blackberries, cherries, currants, cola, anise and sweet smoky oak. The finish is wonderfully dry, firm and long. Should develop for at least eight years.",94,65.0,California
62966,France,"A wine with structure, this achieves balance with its black currant flavor and acidity. It's lined firmly with tannins that bring a dry and texture to this solid, age-worthy bottle. Give it at least five years.",89,61.0,Bordeaux
62967,US,"This captures attention with piercing cherry and cranberry aromas and with herb and orange-peel grace notes. The palate is soft, polished and layered, with a mouthfeel that dazzles and the flavors to back it up. The finish lingers.",91,40.0,Washington
62968,US,"Hard-edged tannins are the star on this wine now, but it does show an enormous heart of blackberries and black currants. Will it age? It is Howell Mountain, so the answer is, probably yes. Drink 2018–2020.",89,65.0,California
62969,France,"The small production of white wine from this estate, owned by the Kressmann family of Latour-Martillac, comes from a deep gravel outcrop. This wine is rich and beautifully ripe. Apricot and juicy pear flavors are backed with the wood aging. It is just ready to drink.",90,20.0,Bordeaux
62970,Argentina,"Berry and cassis aromas turn more saucy with airing. This has a sticky mouthfeel with protruding acids, while flavors of plum and citrus finish short. This is good if you're looking for the basics.",85,13.0,Other
62971,France,"Spice and mint dominate this intensely aromatic wine. Solid and very structured, it is still showing its wood aging and extraction. But its bright future is certain, with the weight of black fruits, the firm tannins and the mineral texture. Guard this wine and don't drink before 2020.",95,295.0,Burgundy
62972,South Africa,"An alluring nose of violets, berries and a touch of spice begins this stylish wine from Waterford. On the palate, flowers, spice and minerals unfold and mingle with elegance. The tannins are pronounced but refined. The wine will age and offer more as time passes, but it's a gorgeous sip today.",91,100.0,Stellenbosch
62973,France,"Bone dry, but soft, this is a complete, rounded Champagne. It has plenty of the Chardonnay mineral character, with fine citrus zest and tight acidity. It is nowhere near mature, so keep for another two years. Impressive.",93,,Champagne
62974,Spain,Compost aromas and a clunky feeling palate get this off on the wrong foot. Flavors of burnt berry fruit and sweetness fail to impress. This shows hardly any snap on a cloying finish.,82,14.0,Northern Spain
62975,US,"This is plush and tasty, with lots of fresh, ripe fruit flavors verging on sweet, but it also has great acidity and appetizing tannins to rein in all that flavor and achieve balance. The flavors resemble raspberry, ripe red cherry and a touch of cinnamon and nutmeg. It's medium to full bodied, dry and finishes with a nice tartness.",90,25.0,California
62976,France,"This firmly structured wine is packed with solid tannins as well as ripe juicy red fruits. It comes from the upper part of the Rugiens Premier Cru, one of the top sites in Pommard. Dense and needing to age, the wine will be ready from 2023.",93,103.0,Burgundy
62977,US,"This is fairly rich in mouthfeel and nicely complex in flavor. It's medium bodied and subtly flavored with nuances of pear, pippin apple, toasted almond and nutmeg. Enough crisp acidity shows through to balance the body and keeps the flavors singing on the finish.",88,11.0,California
62978,US,"A dry, crisp Pinot Noir with interestingly ripe flavors of cherries, oranges and cola. Maybe a little overpriced for what you get, but it's a pretty wine.",86,34.0,California
62979,US,"Lots of cool-climate Syrah character in this wine. It's dry and full-bodied, with blackberry, plum, bacon and black pepper aromas and flavors. Too light for aging, so drink now.",84,24.0,California
62980,US,"This lower end wine from Harlan's stable is as good as most Napa wineries' best. It's beautiful to drink right now, showing class and distinction. Tasted alone, its burst of black currants and cherries is rich, without any trace of overripeness.",92,85.0,California
62981,US,"Pretty cranberry and light red berry fruits are swathed in a decidedly herbal, earthy blanket. Nothing is over-matched however, as all these 2012 Winderlea Pinots show perfect balance. The finish brings a light dusting of cocoa.",89,48.0,Oregon
62982,Italy,"Oak, vanilla, underbrush and spiced plum scents float out of the glass. The palate is lean and linear, offering sour cherry and star anise flavors, pulled taut by firm acidity and refined tannins.",88,,Tuscany
62983,Italy,"Bold, thick and chewy, this masculine blend of Montepulciano and Cabernet Franc delivers lasting aromas of pipe tobacco, cinnamon, jammy blackberry and dried herb. The finish is driven by a soft, chocolate-fudge-like aftertaste.",91,49.0,Central Italy
62984,Italy,"A blend of grapes including traditional Corvina and Rondinella undergoes air-drying for extra-rich concentration and intensity. That, with careful oak aging, has shaped a richly textured, dense wine that would pair with game meat or bean soup with smoked bacon. It shows raw, slightly chewy tannins on the close.",88,20.0,Veneto
62985,US,"Sanguine and floral, this soft wine exudes waxy plum and cherry around a midweight core of earthiness. Shy in fruit, it finishes with a somewhat diluted character.",86,38.0,California
62986,Italy,"You'll find all the pleasing aromas that you normally associate with a no-fuss Chardonnay such as apricot, honey and white stone in this wine. This is an easy, quaffable wine that lacks great depth but that would pair well with light, casual meals.",86,11.0,Northeastern Italy
62987,US,"There's a noticeable tilt of barrel reduction in this wine that keeps it more closed-off than desired. Otherwise, the experience is full bodied in baked bread and black cherry, with a tangy freshness to the finish.",87,30.0,California
62988,US,"From the dark color, plummy aroma and heavy mouthfeel, you know this is a big, ponderous Pinot Noir. Nothing light or silky about it. Packs a punch with red berry, mushroom, red currant and smoked meat flavors, with the tannic pack of a Syrah, and finishes very dry. Aging is a gamble.",87,28.0,California
62989,France,"Perfume partners with great acidity in this wine. The two work in harmony, resulting in a wine that has a soft texture, rich, jammy berry fruits and a backbone of tannins that will allow for aging. Drink from 2017.",93,60.0,Burgundy
62990,US,"It would be interesting to slip this marvelous Riesling into a blind tasting of Mosel wines. Superb balance and finesse underscore the delicately rendered flavors of peach, apricot and lemon tea. A scent of powdered sugar is the only suggestion of the 1% residual sugar.",91,15.0,Washington
62991,US,"This Cabernet Sauvignon blend includes Merlot, Syrah and a small amount of “other,” yielding a well-rounded, ripe wine with lush flavors of blueberry and blackberry. The tangy acids spark a finish of fresh herb, licorice and tobacco.",89,14.0,Washington

62993,Italy,"Here's a delightful rosso, offering spicy and earthy fragrances of clove and pepper as well as whiffs of leather and forest floor.

62994,US,"This traditional blend of 36% Merlot, 34% Cabernet Sauvignon, 19% Cabernet Franc, 7% Petit Verdot and 4% Malbec offers the expected aromas of cedar, plums, tobacco, cracked pepper and slight mint. It's very easy on the palate, with boysenberries and a woody complexity, proving light and tasty.",88,55.0,California
62995,US,"This is the winery's first vintage of prominently labeling its reserve-tier Cab under the To Kalon name, a nod to the vineyard's importance in the blend, which is almost all Cabernet Sauvignon, with handfuls of Cabernet Franc and Petit Verdot. Soft and structured, it's a subtly powerful wine, offering cassis, cranberry, dried herb and savory touch of black tea.",93,145.0,California
62996,US,"An interesting and different Syrah, and a promising release from a young brand to watch. The wine is very high in acidity, giving it a firm grip. The flavors are tremendously rich, offering a tsunami of blackberries, currants, plum sauce, baker's chocolate, leather, grilled meat, pine nut and black pepper. It's youthfully aggressive right now in tannins, and needs time for all the serious parts to marry. Leave it alone until sometime in 2010, and it should haul for years after.",94,48.0,California
62997,France,It's the smoky flavors and acidity that dominate this fresh wine. It has hints of black-currant flavors that may develop although the wine is light and shows more dry tannins than fruit at this stage. Think about waiting until 2018.,85,15.0,Bordeaux
62998,France,"Made from organically grown grapes, this is a new wine from Barton & Guestier, a fresh, very herbaceous Sauvignon Blanc. It is bright with pear and green fruits to go with a big twist of lemon. Screwcap.",85,,Loire Valley
62999,Germany,"Intensely concentrated flavors of sweet cantaloupe, tangerine and peach belie the difficulties inherent to Mosel's 2013 vintage. This spätlese is unusually rich and silken on the palate, yet maintains a thrilling high-acid profile. Finishes long with lingering notes of honeysuckle and saffron.",93,78.0,Mosel
63000,US,This unoaked Chardonnay is powered by tangy lemon and pineapple flavors. It's medium-bodied and has nice concentration without seeming overly ripe. Butter and vanilla touches weave through its lively fresh fruit notes.,88,17.0,California

63006,US,"While the nose on this Chardonnay is decidedly savory, with notes of cooked apples and buttery cheese rinds, the palate is surprisingly feminine, with pretty orange-blossom and apple jelly notes. Opulent and fruity, yet refreshingly-balanced in alcohol and acidity.",85,21.0,Virginia
63007,France,"Favorable exchange rates have lowered the price of this gem to nearly everyday status, making it a terrific value. Ripe melon and red berry flavors are supported by a firm bed of crushed stone, then garnished by subtle spice notes. Typical of Tavel, it's on the full-bodied side for a rosé, but doesn't seem heavy at all. Drink now–2018.",92,16.0,Rhône Valley
63008,Germany,"A strike of tangerine acidity serves as a palate jolting introduction to this vibrant sun-kissed Riesling. Dusty mineral, pollen and honey tones converge into a luscious slick that lingers persistently and persuasively.",94,94.0,Rheingau
63009,New Zealand,"The aromas feature a subtle interplay between roses, red fruit and earthier elements, with the flavors following along in a similar vein. But where this wine excels is in its texture—supremely silky—and finish, which shows excellent persistence. A complex and elegant expression of North Island Pinot Noir.",91,50.0,Wairarapa
63010,US,"This wine brings crystal clear aromas of candy corn, summer squash, clarified butter, spice and whiffs of tropical fruit. The palate is elegant in style, showing nuance and detail to the straw flavors that lead to a warm finish.",90,40.0,Washington
63011,US,"This excellent rosé is one of a handful given extra bottle age before release, and it rewards that time with unusual flavors––rhubarb and strawberry, hints of banana and a touch of creamsicle in the fade. Not typical in any way, but tasty and full-bodied.",88,16.0,Washington
63012,France,"Owned by the Bernard family who also own one of the major Bordeaux negociants, Millésima, the wine is structured, deliciously fruity and with a series of smoky tannins that will allow it to age. It comes from a vineyard close to Pauillac and that shows in the dense Cabernet Sauvignon that gives the wine its weight. Drink from 2021.",91,17.0,Bordeaux
63013,US,"Named for a barrel that once rolled off a cliff, this forward fruity wine blends numerous sources to craft an easy-drinking, no-frills style. Think a strawberry lollipop in a glass, and you're on the right track. That's not to say it lacks concentration, but its strength is the pretty fruit.",88,23.0,Oregon
63014,Chile,"Dark, rubbery aromas yield to black cherry and spice, while the full-bodied palate has both sweet flavors of blackberry and cola but also some acid, tartness and pie cherry character. Drying, solid and full of red plum and berry fruit.",87,17.0,Maipo Valley
63015,Australia,"Beyond a hint of stuck flint on the nose, this offers clean, varietally correct aromas and flavors of white nectarine, grapefruit and gooseberry. It's nicely balanced in the middle of the spectrum, offering a harmonious mix of stone fruit and citrus.",88,13.0,South Australia
63016,US,"With residual sugar measuring 17 g/L, this puts the emphasis on fruit flavors that are forward, round, ripe and slightly sweet. It's right down the heart of the plate in terms of Washington styles; apple and peach the main flavors.",88,10.0,Washington
63017,US,"Voluptuous in wild strawberry, cranberry and tart cherry, Quintus is light and suggestively chalky, balanced in velvety tannins and a backbone of structure. Dancing in the background is a taste of black tea and dark, fragrant earth.",93,75.0,California
63018,US,"Theoretically a very light rosé, the “Eye of the Partridge” is really a Pinot Noir blanc in this vintage, and joins a growing cohort of such wines from Oregon. Strong acids compete with some residual sugar, in a tart and sappy wine chock full of yellow plum, white raspberries and citrus fruit. It's rich and delicious, with impressive length and concentration.",91,20.0,Oregon
63019,France,"This is a big, bold wine with scents of ripe pear and a hint of anise. The fruit seems to grow and add dimension in the mouth, featuring pears and peaches that are topped off with a dollop of spicy oak and butter.",88,47.0,Burgundy
63020,US,"A pretty purplish pink, this rose shows deep cherry, ripe strawberry and bubblegum-ish notes on the lush nose. The palate is slightly effervescent but with crisper flavors than the nose suggests, offering cherry blossom and steely minerality, finishing crisp and tart.",87,14.0,California
63021,France,"The wine comes from a 14-acre estate owned by the producer. Its fruitiness and texture are both important elements in the wine at this young stage. They give a tightly textured wine that is still bright, crisp with lemon fruit and crispened with considerable acidity. Let the wine soften and drink from 2018.",90,30.0,Loire Valley
63022,US,"The grape's stereotypical green nose gets a whole new interpretation, with aromas of sunburned hay, bags of desiccated grass and wild oregano. The herbaceous characters carry the palate, but it's smooth with thyme and chile verde flavors, and a lingering bit of citrus tartness and tannic grip.",92,20.0,California
63023,US,"A dry, slightly washed-out Sauvignon Blanc, with varietally correct flavors of apple and herb. Thins out quickly, but a decent quaffer at this price.",85,7.0,Washington
63024,Italy,"A blend of 80% Sangiovese, 10% Merlot and 10% Cabernet Sauvignon, this opens with aromas that recall mature plum, violet, oak and a whiff of exotic spice.

63025,US,"This is a gorgeous wine, blended with 8% Merlot, 1% Petit Verdot and 1% Malbec, and aged entirely in new French oak.

63030,France,"Dark in style, as is often the case here, with a hard, tough edge. It is austere, the fruit a mere hint in the background. It does have potential, although this will come slowly.",89,,Bordeaux

63036,US,"This is essentially DDO's reserve Pinot Noir; it requires some patience at first, because it is quite tight, almost inscrutable. With many hours of breathing it fleshes out and opens up, revealing a wine with interesting nuances of cured meat, mushroom and light earth. The fruit is a notch more concentrated and full than the regular DDO, but retains a sense of tart berry and light cherry rather than being sweet or jammy. This absolutely must be decanted well in advance.",92,65.0,Oregon
63037,France,"The spicy aroma and burnt toast character of this young wine reflects its strong wood aging. The black fruit is right behind though, likely to break through the dry surface over the next few months. Drink from 2019.",86,24.0,Bordeaux
63038,US,"Here's a soft, lushly delicious wine to drink now with steak, veal, pork, chicken or just about anything that wants a dry, medium-bodied red wine. It's rich in berry, currant, tobacco, spice and cedar flavors, and possesses that hard to define quality of finesse.",87,35.0,California

63050,France,"Aromas of mulberry, boysenberry, underbrush and dried lavendar lead to notes of black currant, dried herb and crushed granite on the palate.

63056,US,"Young and tight, this requires aggressive aeration before it begins to show much flavor. It's worth the effort, as it evolves into a dense, delicious wine that marries its juicy stone fruits to a rich mix of vanilla, coconut and caramel components from the barrel aging. Drink 2018 to 2030.",92,65.0,Oregon
63057,Austria,"Just hinting at more mature flavors, this is an intense wine, its acidity almost overwhelming. Red currant, spice and concentrated juiciness are all elements in this dense wine. The acidity does suggest longer aging, so drink now and until 2022. Screwcap.",93,,Kremstal

63174,Germany,"Sweet and savory go hand-in-hand in this intensely smoky, yet penetratingly fruity wine. It's a deeply mineral Spätlese, marked by dark, dusty streaks of slate, yet brimming with vibrant tangerine and peach flavors. A spike of electric acidity leads a long, long finish.",94,92.0,Rheingau
63175,US,"Aromas of wet stone, smoke and petrol seep evocatively into the sweet pineapple bouquet. The palate is dry but deeply concentrated with a ripe stone fruit character. Finishes briskly with a bracing lime juice acidity.",89,30.0,New York
63176,Chile,"Chunky, meaty, saucy plum and berry aromas are green and gritty. This is solid feeling on first blush, but then it collapses and turns clampy and tannic. Minimal berry and cassis flavors battle with herbal, green notes in front of a chubby, imprecise finish.",85,16.0,Colchagua Valley
63177,France,"A superb wine, the tannins carrying along the dense structure with ease and grace. The purity of the ripe berry fruit is very marked, with acidity giving freshness to the sweet wine. The whole ensemble is developing well, but will need many years' aging.",95,115.0,Burgundy
63178,US,"From a little-used San Luis Obispo County appellation, a simple wine with little to recommend it beyond cleanliness and some berry flavors. Fully dry, it has silky tannins and some firm acids.",83,28.0,California
63179,US,"A sweet-smelling wine with notes of overripe pear, pineapple and jasmine. It also drinks quite sweet (26g/L residual sugar) but doesn't have the acid or flavor concentration to match.",84,9.0,Washington
63180,New Zealand,"Cloudy Bay's latest vintage is the first from their own vineyards in Central Otago and reflects a step up in quality despite a challenging vintage. Plummy fruit dominates the rather chunky wine, framed by hints of toast and dried herbs, while moderately dusty tannins and bright acids mark the finish. Drink 2018–2025.",90,75.0,Central Otago
63181,France,"From the Aube region in the south of Champagne, this is a rich and soft wine, on the sweet side for a Brut. It has a warm feeling to it, ripe and with apricot and apple fruit flavors. Rounded and full in the mouth, it is ready to drink.",87,35.0,Champagne
63182,US,"A broad texture and mellow flavors characterize this full-bodied, rich and warming wine. The aromas and flavors recall black cherries and clove with a touch of woody or earthy character, but it's the lush mouthfeel that's most memorable.",92,60.0,California
63183,US,"Dried red fruit, a touch of tar, fresh violets and cola spice show on this bottling's nose, which is reserved in style. Dried strawberry and cranberry flavors unfold on the palate, along with hints of caramel and hibiscus, proving refreshing if not deep in style.",88,40.0,California
63184,Italy,"Made with organically grown grapes, this blend of 85% Sangiovese, 10% Alicante and 5% Ciliegiolo has aromas of underbrush, spiced plum, blue flower, menthol and leather. The palate delivers juicy black cherry, clove, carob, star anise and a tarry note alongside supple, smooth tannins. It's an earthy, intriguing expression from Scansano.",90,20.0,Tuscany
63185,Portugal,"This is a minty, aromatic Syrah, with tannins that are laced with violet and blackberry flavors. It's finely structured, and shows a spice charcter from the fruit that combines easily with the wood toast. Age for 4 years.",91,38.0,Tejo
63186,US,"This Bordeaux-style blend, from a choice section of the Seven Hills Vineyard, is fragrant with a beguiling mix of fruits, flowers and fresh herbs. Cassis and pepper, Asian spices and a lingering, textural mouthfeel, make this a wine that disappears all too quickly from the bottle.",93,55.0,Washington
63187,US,"Extremely ripe and fragrant aromas of strawberry preserves smell quite quaffable on this decently priced wine. Flavors of raspberry, anise, rhubarb and clove-like spice are nicely rounded and finish up with smoky bacon fat elements.",88,24.0,California
63188,US,"What a nice Merlot, Brander's best yet. It's easy to drink now for the rich array of cherries, currants, cola, smoked meat and cedar, brightened with brisk acidity. But give it an hour or two in the decanter to soften and mellow.",89,22.0,California
63189,France,"When T-L gets the mix of fruit and oak right, the wines can be deliciously hedonistic. This is a beautiful mix of cedar, vanilla and chocolate with bright boysenberry fruit, wrapped in a richly velvety texture and lingering elegantly on the finish. Drink 2012–2020.",91,35.0,Rhône Valley
63190,Chile,"Despite a persistent front-to-back sweetness, this is a nice little Chardonnay for those fastened to the grape. It starts with ripe pineapple and apple aromas, and next you get tropical fruit, citrus and banana flavors. Medium in size and good for what it strives to be.",85,8.0,Central Valley
63191,Italy,"This Amarone boasts black cherry and plum flavors layered with notes of toasted oak, black pepper and chocolate. The alcohol is noticeable on the palate, with a warmth to the finish. It's not overly complex, but the fruit is delicious.",89,69.0,Veneto
63192,US,"Made from a selection of high-end vineyards otherwise sourced for single-vineyard wines, this is a stellar offering and a steal of a deal for the quality, a mix of funky, lightly spiced dark plum and black cherry that's unfussy in its approach.

63195,US,"From a coastal vineyard in the southwest corner of the Russian River Valley, this is earthy and brambly on the nose, inviting in its sense of wild abandon.

63196,Italy,"Mature black fruit, spice, underbrush and tobacco aromas lead the nose on this full-bodied wine. The round, robust palate delivers spicy plum, blackberry, ground black pepper and licorice alongside big but velvety tannins. The heat of alcohol is evident.",89,300.0,Tuscany
63197,Spain,"Although this blend is perfectly good, it does have an herbal, green, minty streak that's likely due to the 30% Syrah and Cabernet bolstering 70% Garnacha. Aromas of mint, herbs, milk chocolate and plastic lead to snappy herb, spice, plum and raspberry flavors. The finish is fiery, drying and spicy.",86,14.0,Northern Spain
63198,US,"Dull and insipid, with little Pinot character beyond some modest berry flavors and easy tannins. Turns gluey and thick on the dry finish.",82,9.0,California
63199,US,"An uneasy mix of steel and butter, this may just need a bit more time to settle. At the moment, the twin elements of metal and popcorn clash and compete. For those who love the buttery style, this should prove pleasing.",86,12.0,Washington
63200,US,"Dry and tart in acids, with lemon Lifesaver candy, lemongrass, hay, white pepper and vanilla aromas and flavors. A clean, brisk Sauvignon Blanc to drink as an appetizer. Good with Asian fare.",90,16.0,California
63201,France,"This apple-crisp wine has tight acidity and touches of wood rounded out by yellow fruits. It is ripe and very full, the nervy, mineral character contrasting with the richness that is now developing. It will age slowly, so don't drink before 2020.",95,97.0,Burgundy
63202,US,"Made in a very ripe, intensely concentrated style, this tannic young Cabernet is massive in blackberries, currants and cedar. It's a huge, impressive wine that needs at least 6–8 years in the cellar.",92,40.0,California
63203,US,"Named after founder Iris Rideau's mother, Olivia Daliet, this impressive bottling shows dense and initially shy aromas of blueberry, blackcurrant, charred rosemary and cola on the nose. There's a lot of charcoal amd zesty purple fruit to the sip, with juicy acidity presenting poppyseed flavors.",92,70.0,California
63204,US,"Just 50 cases exist of this cellar-worthy bottling from a team of restaurant professionals. The nose offers rounded plum pie, clove and inviting vanilla bean, while the palate is framed by chalky tannins that ensure long life, presenting flavors of baked black cherry, peppercorn, graphite, light mulberry and tart pomegranate. Drink 2018–2028.",93,50.0,California
63205,US,"Fans of ripe, forward fruit will like this wine. Opens with a burst of jammy plum and cassis and then explodes into fruit and berry sensations on the palate, but it's classically dry. Soft tannins and acids support all these luscious flavors. The finish is really long and spicy.",91,19.0,California
63206,US,"Spicy, slightly resinous with notes of leaf, clove and licorice that complement good dark cassis fruit. Some coffee and smoke enter into the middle and finish, though the flavors fall away rather quickly. It's well balanced and a pleasure to drink, but not built for cellaring.",88,23.0,Washington
63207,Israel,"Brisk and vibrant with juicy plum, cherry and earthy herbal flavors. Accents of cocoa and thin mint develop on the lingering finish. Drink now.",84,24.0,Upper Galilee
63208,France,"With wood-based aromas, this is currently a closed, taut wine. It has green fruits and minerality; it's nervy and under tension. The acidity is crisp while very light in character. This is for aging.",93,40.0,Burgundy
63209,US,"This well-made wine, blended with small percentages of Petit Verdot, Cabernet Franc, Malbec and Merlot, is an astounding value. Currant and cranberry notes and an underbelly of tannins play together in a smooth texture of rich concentration.",92,26.0,California
63210,Spain,"This Syrah is big, rubbery and heavily charred on the nose, with iodine and minerally notes kicking in. The palate is deep but not too heavy, with juicy acidity.

63211,US,"Cabernet Sauvignon (30%) takes the lead on this wine, followed by Merlot (21%), Syrah (17%), Cabernet Franc (14%) and five other varieties.

63215,US,"Powerful scents mix dried herb, wet grass and petrol—it could be mistaken for Sauvignon Blanc in a blind tasting, and it has that much density and extract. The label says dry, and it is certainly that, much in the Australian style. Big, concentrated, high acid and quite cellarworthy.",91,20.0,Oregon
63216,US,"This wine packs a punch of flavor for the price, and is made in large enough quantities to find easily. Vibrant in lemon, lime and mandarin orange, it's smooth, refreshing and delicious.",90,16.0,California
63217,US,"This is the kind of Cabernet that's soft and accessible enough to drink now. It's rich in blackberry, cherry and spice flavors, with a sweet edge of charred wood. Saved from mere simplicity by a fine, firm tannic structure.",92,25.0,California
63218,US,"In 2004 new winemaker William Ammons began at Glen Fiona, and this is the first of his wines to be released. This is spicy with pepper and herb, both in the nose and in the mouth. The fruit is quite tart and tastes of rhubarb and cranberry.",86,30.0,Washington

63220,France,"This smoky wine has firm tannins and a tough core. The juicy fruit is taking its time to develop, although it will give the wine density and ripe berries in time. The vineyard, created in the early 1980s is now at peak maturity. Drink from 2017.",87,18.0,Bordeaux
63221,France,"A cool, very Sauvignon wine, with strong herbaceous and citrus flavors. It's crisp, showing a bright, tight, slightly mineral texture.",86,15.0,Bordeaux
63222,US,"Deeply colored, this bottling shows ripe blackberry pie with caramel, crushed graphite and a touch of mint on the nose. The tannins are soft but provide just enough structure to deliver lavish flavors of black cherry, beef char and cedar.",89,40.0,California
63223,Chile,"Orange and lime aromas control the nose on this spritzy, tangy wine that literally shows bubbles in the glass. The flavors are lemony and sharp, with a grassy accent. Tasted twice.",84,15.0,Casablanca Valley
63224,US,"With tight acidity like a squeeze of lemon and a lightness of being, this Pinot can be described as elegant rather than opulent. The feral, exotic flavors of pine cones, wild herbs, tea, raspberries and cola suggest the Fort Ross area. There's an exciting complexity and challenge to this wine. It doesn't dazzle you, but makes you think about it, and will certainly reward pairing with serious foods, as it changes in the glass.",92,45.0,California
63225,US,"The structure on this Pinot Noir is great, with brisk acidity and firm tannins accompanying dry flavors. There are succulent notes of sour cherry and raspberry candy, tart pomegranates and cola, but the wine is rustic, with no future.",85,21.0,California
63226,US,"A non-vintage blend of 42% Cabernet Franc, 29% Cabernet Sauvignon and 29% Sangiovese, this is built upon strong, herbal tannins. The addition of the Sangiovese brings in fat, buttery oak flavors that linger through the finish.",87,18.0,Washington

63228,Chile,"Aromas of sweet berry fruit and cherry lean toward medicinal. The palate is juicy due to bold acidity, and the flavors settle on main street cherry. There's a buttery oak note on the finish, but overall it's more basic and fruity than supple and complex.",88,23.0,Central Valley
63229,Israel,"Underipe nectarine, lemon pith and a touch of freshly dried grass start off the bouquet of this Chardonnay. The medium-weight palate transitions into ripe flavors of melon and pear flesh that carry through to the slightly flabby finish.",86,,Galilee
63230,New Zealand,"This restaurant favorite struts its stuff in the nose, providing an ample blast of pungent grapefruit, passion fruit and mint.

The finish is clean and proper, with citrus flavors flowing on a stream of vital acidity.",88,18.0,Marlborough
63231,US,"A brilliant Pinot Noir, grown organically from the winery's new vineyard in a cool part of the coastal mountains. More tannic and acidic than Pinots from the estate vineyard in Green Valley, it offers lush, deep flavors of cherries, black raspberries, gingersnap cookies and almond biscotti. Just terrific, and will take a few years of bottle age in a cool cellar.",94,49.0,California
63232,US,"This Merlot over-delivers for the everyday price. It's bone dry and classically structured, with rich, ripe tannins and mouthwatering acidity framing flavors of cherries, red and black currants, dusty spices and cedar. Sommeliers, scoop this one up. More than 15,000 cases produced.",87,11.0,California
63233,France,"While there is a somewhat meaty edge to this wine, it also has good rich texture. It probably needs time to bring out the full potential of its ripe yellow fruits.",88,48.0,Burgundy
63234,US,"Earns extra credit for the sheer audacity of ripe cherry, raspberry and vanilla cream flavors. Almost as sweet as a candy bar, but actually dry, and balanced with acidity and minerals. A fine Pinot Noir that should develop bottle complexity over the next six years.",90,45.0,California
63235,US,"A thick, rich and balanced expression of great, estate-owned dirt, this wine has well-developed elements of green apple, pear and lemon, with teases of wet stone and gravelly minerality.",90,28.0,California
63236,US,"Key-lime rinds, pink grapefruit, crisp pluot, just-ripe pineapple, nectarine and a steely gunmetal aroma show on the nose of this bottling. There's an intriguing touch of sweet onion to the sip. The laser-sharp precision would pair well with shellfish, but a slightly buttered warmth makes the bottling quite versatile.",92,26.0,California
63237,US,"Whereas many Syrahs from this vintage from the Rocks District show more fruit than usual, this wine is clearly rooted in the stones. It's aromatically expressive with black olive, crushed flowers, mineral, black pepper and an earthy funk. Flavors are silky soft in feel, with a well-balanced mixture of fruit and savory notes that leads to a lingering finish.",92,40.0,Washington

63241,US,"Ultraripe fruit, strong tannins and porty, high alcohol give this wine a certain rusticity. Blended from Cabernet Sauvignon, Syrah and Petite Sirah in almost equal parts, it's rich in blackberries, red licorice, crushed peppercorn and sandalwood.",86,40.0,California

63243,US,"Absolutely delicious now, this barrel selection of Tandem's different vineyard designates dazzles with flashy flavors of raspberry and cherry tart, cola, persimmon, pomegranate and cinnamon-pepper, elaborated with the bubbling brown sugar accents of oak. Should last for quite a long time without gaining complexity, so best now–2012 with things like grilled salmon, lamb or a fine steak.",92,60.0,California
63244,US,"Broad and easy in texture, this is tempting to drink because of its near sweetness. Baking spices, possibly from oak add-ins, fill the aroma, and candylike cherry and strawberry flavors flood the mouth.",85,9.0,California
63245,Italy,"This Cabernet Sauvignon emphasizes delicate, feminine aromas that are rare to find in the variety. Small berry, toasted almond and herbs are buoyant and fresh. But Cabernet's hearty character definitely comes through midpalate thanks to jackhammer tannins and thick concentration. Drink after 2012.",92,49.0,Tuscany
63246,Switzerland,"A soft blackberry, vanilla and plum nose is followed by a rustic mélange of dried tea, berry and spice flavors in this Merlot. Tannins are firm and the overall flavors good, but the wine needs a little more cohesion.",83,38.0,Ticino
63247,New Zealand,"A decent value in New Zealand Pinot Noir, the 2008 Wild Rock displays aromas of bright if somewhat simple cherry fruit.

63249,US,"This high-toned, lovely wine is a best-of blend from several vineyards—primarily Ritchie and Banfield. Sugar pie apple and fig flavors form a robustly concentrated fruitiness that's ribbed with vibrant minerality. A clarified butter-like creaminess comes through on the finish.",96,54.0,California
63250,France,The red wine from this vineyard (which also produces a white) is firm with layers of toast from wood aging as well as the potential for ripe red fruits. It is going to need some time to lose that spicy flavor that currently dominates the wine. Give it until 2021.,88,45.0,Burgundy
63251,New Zealand,"Matariki's 2008 is a medium-bodied, slightly grassy effort, with ripe passion fruit and nectarine flavors framed by subtle hints of smoke and herb. It's concentrated but harmonious at the same time, making it very easy to drink.",88,25.0,Hawke's Bay

63253,US,"The second release of Figgins—a single wine produced by Leonetti's Chris Figgins—is astonishing. Tasted in a lineup of exceptional Walla Walla reds, it outshined them all. It's a sophisticated blend of Cabernet Sauvignon, Petit Verdot and Merlot, from the Figgins Vineyard, with gorgeous aromas of flowers, spices and black fruits. Seamless and long, complex and forceful without being overpowering, it can stand alongside top tier Bordeaux costing four or five times as much.",98,85.0,Washington

63255,New Zealand,"Plummy yet herbal at the same time, this Pinot from the folks at Craggy Range hints at rhubarb and beet greens, but relies on a sturdy core of sour plum to carry it.

63259,Germany,"A crush of mineral notes on the nose lend earthy dimension to this buoyantly ripe, fruity auslese.

Ready to drink now but it will shine for decades to come.",94,64.0,Mosel

63261,US,"A 100% varietal wine entirely from the producer's Napa side of its property, this special cuvée is thick and rich in black and blue fruit, generously soft and silky on the palate with well-integrated oak.

63262,US,"Black Eyed Peas singer Fergie and Winemaker Joey Tensley converge on a blend of Syrah, Merlot, Grenache and Cabernet Sauvignon that's worth sitting on until at least 2019.

63268,US,"A mix of Pommard and 667 clones, this spent 16 months in 18% new French oak.

63281,Argentina,"Too heavy, murky and pruney on the nose; this wine has a lot of size but little freshness. It's big and bust-out, but with no direction or finesse it comes across earthy and oily. Only 250 cases made.",83,18.0,Mendoza Province
63282,US,"Plump dark raspberries and ripe cherries combine with herbes de provence, slight lavender and a slightly gamy quality on this wine's elegant nose. Floral-driven flavors of hibiscus, rose hips and elderflower spice up the woody elderberry fruit, settling into Mediterranean herbs and a soft zing that goes deep into the finish.",94,60.0,California
63283,Italy,"Savory and ripe, this organically produced wine opens with aromas of dark plum, blackberry and blue flowers. The open, easygoing palate offers juicy black cherry accented with notes of clove and anise. Polished tannins provide the framework.",88,25.0,Tuscany
63284,US,"Vibrant aromas of honeysuckle, jasmine, mandarin orange and petroleum jelly lead to just off-dry, lightly spritzy fruit flavors. Tart, lively acidity keeps the interest high.",88,15.0,Washington
63285,US,"Made in an old-fashioned Paso Robles style, this is pretty sweet, soft and simple. There's not much complexity, but it has plenty of ripe blackberry, cherry and spice flavors.",84,20.0,California
63286,US,"Raspberry fruit shines through with ample backing acidity. The flavors are true and fresh, though the wine seems to thin out midpalate. It was fermented with wild yeast and aged for 15 months in the barrel.",88,40.0,Oregon
63287,US,"The best Clos Pegase Sauvignon Blanc in years. Made with a little oak, just enough for creaminess, it's marked by vibrant acidity and complex, lovely flavors of lemongrass, Meyer lemon candy, vanilla, white pepper and the distinct minerality that Carneros white wines often display. Great price for a wine this sophisticated.",91,20.0,California
63288,US,"Blended from Petite Sirah, Syrah and Barbera, this is a hearty red wine that's tannic and jammy, with a honeyed finish. It's fine with burgers.",83,13.0,California
63289,New Zealand,"This Hawkes Bay wine seems to be trying to out-Marlborough Marlborough. Scents of crushed tomato leaves are aggressively green, while the acids are crisp, to say the least. That said, it comfortably rides the border between pleasure and pain, ending with notes of razor-like lime juice and soothing, dusty chalk.",88,16.0,Hawke's Bay
63290,US,"This well-crafted reserve boasts a solid core of blueberry and black cherry fruit, thickly accented with dark chocolate notes. Produced from heritage (Calera, Swan and Mt. Eden) clones, it's textural and dense, with dark char, espresso and black licorice flavors.",93,80.0,Oregon
63291,Spain,"Cheesy tomato-based aromas are rubbery and fiery. This feels lean and monotone. Stewed, salty flavors of earthy berry fruits are off base and dirty, while this is cheesy tasting on the finish.",82,10.0,Northern Spain
63292,US,"Cherry-rhubarb juice, shiitake mushrooms, sagebrush and iron make for a lush and layered nose on this appellation-blend wine that is widely available. The palate begins with plush red cherry then dives into oregano, sage and mace spice. It's expertly complex for a reasonably priced wine.",90,30.0,California
63293,US,"Light and delicate, this wine also offers a lushness to the texture, finding a balance between the two spectrums. Cranberry and strawberry dot a landscape of earthy tobacco and cola-laced oak, finishing with a bold taste of dark chocolate.",90,56.0,California
63294,US,"High-toned aromas of herb, flower, spice and cherry are followed by tart elegantly styled fruit flavors. The new oak influence seems minimal. Pair it with food to see it at its best.",88,35.0,Washington
63295,US,"A bombastic blend of 44% Syrah, 19% Grenache, 18% Cabernet Sauvignon, 10% Mourvèdre and 9% Petite Sirah, this wine offers blueberry ice cream, chocolate-chip cookies, crushed berries and hot gingerbread on the luxurious nose. The palate packs a similarly vast array of flavors that range from tobacco and dried mint to pine forest and pencil shavings, as well as black currant, black loam and baking spice.",93,69.0,California
63296,Argentina,"Quite good and honest, with full raspberry, cherry and tea aromas along with a hint of grassiness. The palate is dark and full-bodied, with toasty cherry and herbal tea flavors. Finishes long, full and several steps ahead of most of the competition. Drink now.",88,30.0,Mendoza Province
63297,US,"This is a velvety smooth, superbly made white with delightful sparks of fresh-squeezed lemon, stone and salt. Ginger and lemongrass touches add an exotic quality, enhancing its bright freshness and core of acid-led tension.",95,70.0,California
63298,France,"This is a round, ripe and deliciously smooth wine. With a warm, vanilla character as well as full and rich fruit, it is generous and ready to drink. The acidity at the end leaves a refreshing aftertaste.",88,30.0,Loire Valley
63299,US,"A standout in the portfolio, this is a sleek, strong effort with tart purple fruits and mineral underpinnings. There's an ample whiff of smoke and a general earthiness around the tannins, with a hint of iron ore. The chalky finish is the only distraction.",89,25.0,Oregon
63300,US,"A fine bottle — full, fleshy, immediately throwing out dense aromatics with toast and roasted coffee and bitter chocolate components. A deep vein of black cherry and cassis keeps the core tight and focused, and a small splash of Syrah adds the scent of black pepper.",91,28.0,Washington
63301,France,"This is a ripe toasty wine. With its red-berry fruits and acidity along with some dry, smoky tannins it is a wine in progress. Drink this concentrated wine from 2018.",87,17.0,Bordeaux
63302,US,"Made from Robert Young-cloned grapes, this wine is perfumed in exotic lychee and briny, salty oak. Fulsome flavors of apple skin are generously expansive on the full-bodied palate.",90,33.0,California
63303,US,"With a smidgen of Petit Verdot, this dark, tight and leathery wine is exalted in tobacco, graphite and tar, still youthfully awkward and shy. The flavors lean savory into meaty aspects of currant and clove, waiting to find companionship in fruit. Drink now after a decant, or cellar through 2023.",92,75.0,California
63304,US,"Reserved aromas of cherry, chocolate, thistle, moist earth and dark berry lead to red and black fruit flavors that are sumptuous, rich and layered. It brings immediate appeal but also offers plenty of cellaring potential—a complete delight that appeals on multiple levels.",93,45.0,Washington
63305,US,"This wine—named for two adjacent vineyards—is 75% Dionysus Cabernet Sauvignon with the balance Bacchus Cabernet Franc. It provides a pleasing assortment of dried and fresh herbs, cherry, flowers and mocha with a seamless, almost creamy feel, bringing an impeccable sense of balance. It's irresistible now but has the stuffing to go the distance.",92,48.0,Washington
63306,US,"This wine is 42% Cabernet Sauvignon, 32% Malbec, 21% Merlot and 5% Petit Verdot. Aromas of blue fruit, plum and green herb lead to dry, slightly astringent fruit flavors, with lemon twist notes on the finish.",87,30.0,Washington

63308,France,"Ripe, round, soft and juicy, this is already attractive and drinkable. It has firm tannins, yet these are cushioned by the sweet black fruits and the lift from the acids. Drink now, or hold this for another year.",87,25.0,Bordeaux
63309,France,"The 2011s from Cornas show high levels of ripeness, and this négociant wine is no exception. It's almost pruny, with other notes of meat, clove and cinnamon, yet remains crisp and firm, picking up hints of black olive and espresso on the finish. Drink now–2025.",91,57.0,Rhône Valley
63310,US,"Light in body and silky in texture, this easy Pinot Noir offers plenty of varietal character. The raspberry and cherry flavors are spicy and sweet.",87,13.0,California
63311,France,"Rich and spicy, this 90% Merlot and 10% Cabernet Sauvignon from 10 acres generous and ripe, with warm tannins and a fruity, red berry character. This blend has attractive acidity and spicy flavors from the combination of wood and stainless-steel aging. This is only the second vintage from enologist Jean-Rémi Larrat's own property. It is worth aging, so drink from 2017.",90,16.0,Bordeaux
63312,US,"A five-grape, Bordeaux-style blend, it's still a big, tough, chewy, tannic wine with a chunky, somewhat blocky mouthfeel. Cherry, cassis and wood flavors dominate, and the tannins are quite astringent. Re-tasted over many hours it remained stubbornly hard and compact. Give this one some further bottle age.",90,50.0,Washington
63313,France,"This aromatic, herbal wine is crisp and lively, with bright acidity and green fruits. Citrus and gooseberry flavors bring out an even fresher side. It finishes light and fruity. Drink now.",87,18.0,Loire Valley
63314,France,"This ripe Saint-Émilion is generous with its rounded perfumed Merlot. It gives the wine richness, juicy acidity and an open texture. Touches of tannin do bring in some structure, but the emphasis is on the fruitiness and fresh aftertaste. Drink from late 2017.",86,20.0,Bordeaux
63315,Germany,"This blend, from several estate vineyards, is slightly off-dry, with a power and thickness to it in the mouth that belies its modest 12.5% alcohol. Honeyed pear and briny gravel notes are complex and satisfying, while reflecting the limestone marl soils of the region.",90,21.0,Rheinhessen
63316,US,"This 100% varietal wine sourced primarily from Oakville Ranch Vineyard is exuberant with rich, round red fruit and earthy sage notes. Bright and lively, with underlying grip, it offers further full-bodied flavors of vanilla, dark chocolate and tobacco as it opens.",92,69.0,California
63317,US,"This is the kind of California Pinot Noir Burgundophiles love to hate. It's so full-bodied and fruity, so forward in currant, chocolate and licorice flavors, that it seems to have nowhere to go — a sin in Burgundy. And yet there's no denying its immediate deliciousness. It fools the palate, now honey sweet, now bone dry, but always rich and spicy.",90,56.0,California
63318,Chile,"Snappy cool-coast aromas of wet stones and green fruits are pungent but not over-the-top aggressive. This is friendly on the palate, with moderate acidity. Flavors of green apple, lime and scallion finish mild and clean. Drink during 2016.",89,24.0,Colchagua Valley
63319,Germany,"This is a fairly full-bodied Mosel auslese, with plenty of both alcohol (9.5%) and remaining sweetness.

Imported by Chapin Cellars, LLC.",91,46.0,Mosel-Saar-Ruwer
63320,New Zealand,"Pleasantly spicy, yet soft in the mouth, this is a medium-bodied Syrah to drink over the near term. Hints of anise, cracked pepper and cedar accent cherry fruit.",86,20.0,Hawke's Bay
63321,US,"There are lots of complex, pleasing flavors in this blend of Cabernet Sauvignon, Petit Verdot and Malbec. It's bone dry, with rich flavors of blackberries, cherries, currants, spices and oak. Drink now as it doesn't have the structure for aging.",87,36.0,California
63322,US,"Cold Creek Vineyard provides the majority of the fruit for this wine, with the rest coming from the Wahluke Slope. It's immediate in its appeal with aromas of cocoa, dark chocolate and black fruit. The coffee flavors show a mixture of fruit and barrel, with some graininess to the tannins.",91,48.0,Washington
63323,US,"Sweet pea blossoms, stone fruits and red raspberries perfume this lovely dry rosé made predominantly from Cabernet Franc and Cabernet Sauvignon. Sparkling acidity and an astringent tea-leaf note add structure to the ripe, supple red-fruit and berry flavors.",89,18.0,New York
63324,France,The wine has a southern character with very ripe fruit that seems unbalanced for the tannins and acidity. It's an odd wine.,83,25.0,Bordeaux
63325,US,"The Australian golf legend now makes wine in California. Compared to your usual fruity Chard, this one's lean and minerally and high in acidity. But it's very clean, with tantalizing suggestions of lemon meringue and Key lime pie, and actually has a lot going for it.",87,14.0,California
63326,Australia,"Shows some rather riper-than-expected fruit flavors, hinting at peach or nectarine as well as the standard apple and lime. The result seems a touch off-dry, although the actual residual sugar is only 3.5 g/L. Despite being lightweight in the mouth, it turns a bit honeyed and weightier on the finish. Drink it over the next few years.",86,20.0,South Australia
63327,Chile,"Briny citrus aromas are pungent, and in general this runs strong on pyrazines and bell pepper scents. A tight, juicy, firm palate is home to citric flavors of pink grapefruit and orange.",85,13.0,Colchagua Valley
63328,Germany,"Initial whiffs of smoke and struck flint fade into pretty pineapple and blossom on the nose of this full-bodied, dry Riesling. Mango and tangerine flavors are riper and heftier on the palate than in many of the Mosel's 2015 Grosses Gewächs wines, neatly balanced by racy acidity and a backbone of cool steel. It's delicious already, but likely to evolve well through the 2020s at least.",94,56.0,Mosel
63329,Spain,"Classic Priorato aromatics of raspberry, cherry, schisty mineral and smoke are welcoming. Elegant and firm in the mouth, with drying tannins and staunch red fruit flavors of cherry and tomato blended with wild herbs and reeds. Earthy and dry on the finish, and not overpowering or overripe.",91,43.0,Catalonia
63330,US,"Though replanted, the vines designated for this bottling were taken from cuttings of the original vineyard blocks dating back to the early 1970s. Pretty in color, aroma and overall balance, this offers substantial black cherry fruit at its core, buttressed with barrel flavors of cacao. The wine shows good penetration and power, helped by aging 16 months in 38% new barrels.",91,60.0,Oregon
63331,France,"Produced from organically grown fruit, this is a delicious refreshing wine. Its red fruits and crisp lemon zest are balanced with the intense acidity and touch of herbs. It is great for summer drinking or as an apéritif.",88,20.0,Provence
63332,France,"Rich and dense, this is full of ripe apple and lemon juice flavors. It's supercharged with acidity that shoots right through the fruitiness and gives a tight, crisp character. Delicious now, but it will be better in 2016.",93,35.0,Burgundy
63333,US,"Lemon custard, ripe Gala apples and a seemingly sweet candy element show on the nose of this wine from a family-owned producer. Bright energy and ripe apple characterize the palate, along with green pear skins and stonefruit.",87,26.0,California
63334,New Zealand,"Spy Valley's 2007 Envoy Pinot Noir is an attractive wine, featuring an exterior of brown sugar, dry leaves and coffee and a fruit-filled cherry center. The only concern is the slightly drying finish and some slightly coarse, rustic tannins. If those resolve gracefully, this rating may look stingy in 3 years' time.",86,55.0,Marlborough
63335,US,"Force Majeure and Ciel du Cheval are the sources for this pure, compelling Red Mountain Syrah. The complex aromatics shoot up a smorgasbord of cured meat, truffle and umami notes, leading into a crisp, racy palate with lovely blueberry-dominated fruit flavors. Aging in 500-liter puncheons smoothes it out while contributing just a hint of new toast.",95,48.0,Washington
63336,Italy,"A blend of 70% Cabernet Sauvignon and 30% Merlot, this wine features earthy aromas of leafy forest floor, tilled soil and dried black currant. The straightforward palate delivers juicy blackberry, raspberry and clove alongside smooth tannins. Drink through 2016.",87,17.0,Tuscany
63337,Italy,"Aromas of toasted oak, espresso, coconut and dried black fruit slowly take shape in the glass. Made entirely with Merlot, the dense palate offers blackberry extract, black cherry, coffee and grilled sage alongside rather astringent tannins that dry out the finish.",89,236.0,Tuscany
63338,US,"Made with 65% Cabernet Sauvignon, 19% Merlot, 10% Malbec and 3% Petit Verdot, this lightly colored wine offers aromas of freshly brewed coffee, cocoa and herbs. Flavors are elegant yet concentrated, with black fruit on the finish.",91,50.0,Washington
63339,US,"This lower-priced Pinot from the Center of Effort team punches way above its weight in this vintage, showing light cherry-blossom and black-cherry aromas mixed with gamy meat and wet slate. Blackberry pie is cut with orange rind on the sip, with an earthy grip showing flavors of juniper, crushed clove and pipe tobacco.",90,19.0,California
63340,Israel,"Aromas of black cherry, saddle leather and coffee prepare the palate for flavors of raspberry, cherry, mocha, and mountainside herbs. There is a pleasing balance of grippy tannins and bright acidity, with an especially zesty flash of cherry on the finish.",88,12.0,Galilee
63341,US,"This wine all comes from Block 18 at this esteemed vineyard. The aromas bring a medley of herbs along with graphite, licorice and black cherry. The palate is medium bodied, but pulls up a bit short on the finish.",88,34.0,Washington
63342,Italy,"Aromas suggesting underbrush, charred earth, toast and mature plum lead the nose. The forward, full-bodied palate offers dried black cherry, licorice and a hint of tobacco alongside polished tannins. It's already accessible so enjoy over the next few years.",89,25.0,Tuscany
63343,US,"The Score swings and mostly misses, despite some interested fruit (mostly Merlot) that brings a brambly berry flavor into the mid-palate. There is a fishy undertaste that wraps into the finish, along with a light hint of cocoa.",84,15.0,Washington
63344,US,"This '06 is the winery's regular bottling, not the reserve, and Chard lovers will find it a little lacking in richness. Still, it's a dry, crisp, elegantly structured wine, with mineral-infused pear and pineapple flavors.",86,24.0,California
63345,Spain,"This five-grape blend is muscular and wide on the palate, with oaky berry flavors that are also tarry and toasty. Hard tannins and some chop on the finish suggest further aging would be beneficial. Drink this Cabernet-led blend that also includes Garnacha, Syrah, Merlot and Cab Franc through 2025.",92,28.0,Northern Spain
63346,US,"Dark blueberry, black plum and blackberry fruits meet with dried violet, lavender and cracked pavement on the nose of this bottling. The palate picks up a soy-meets-blueberry-chiffon element, with splashes of rosewater and cola.",88,25.0,California
63347,US,"Fragrant and plush aromas of cassis, blueberry and black cherry mix with strong notes of licorice and black olive. Silky, detailed, supple and beautifully proportioned, this is a terrific value.",91,25.0,Washington
63348,Germany,"A heady bouquet of orange blossoms opens this lithe, vivaciously sparkling Riesling. Delicately moussed, it's elegant and spry on the palate with a shock of lemon-lime acidity that highlights luscious flavors of peach, apricot, honey and blossom. Lingers long on the finish with a delicate crushed-stone minerality.",90,25.0,Mosel

63350,US,"While sunny melon and peach flavors are forward and fruity, an underlining of chalky minerality lends finesse and elegance to this dry, neatly composed wine. It feels sprightly on the palate, finishing briskly on a lifted white-blossom note.",88,20.0,New York
63351,New Zealand,"Like most unoaked Chardonnays, this is a bit simply fruity, but it's also clean and fresh. Apple, melon and citrus flavors are easily carried by its medium body and mouthwatering finish.",86,16.0,Marlborough
63352,Spain,"Good but basic wine from southern Spain that shows cherry aromas with a citrusy twist. The mix is Monastrell with Syrah and Tempranillo, and as a whole it is composed, with berry, plum and other straightforward flavors. A plump, friendly sort of wine that isn't too complicated.",86,12.0,Levante
63353,US,"The McIntyre family took over their Santa Lucia Highlands vineyards in 1987. The wine kicks off with aromas of black mustard, violet and dark spices. Once sipped, the mouthfeel is rich and full, but the nondescript flavors fall somewhere between tart cranberry and warm strawberry.",89,36.0,California
63354,Israel,"Aromas of black currant, orange zest and lemon thyme set the scene for a three-way balancing act of fruit, savory and cool flavors. On the palate, notes of black cherry, lingonberry, eucalyptus, mint and thyme stand out, and gentle tannins ride on through a cherry and mint finish.",90,70.0,Galilee
63355,US,"A luscious and elegant nose promises richness, and the flavors deliver even more than expected. The backbone of zingy acidity finds a perfect match with flavors of white peach, lime, and poached pear.

63356,France,"This wine has no added sulfur, giving crisp, clear and clean fruitiness. It also adds an light touch of oxidation that broadens the wine and makes the white stone fruit richer. Drink this impressively ripe wine from 2018.",94,50.0,Loire Valley
63357,Austria,"Nutty flavors of new oak signal a more international style of Pinot, but the underlying fruit speaks eloquently of ripe, red cherry and offers glimpses of raspberry. Subtle spice plays around the edges. The palate is rounded and soft but has a refreshing vein of acidity.",90,20.0,Burgenland

63359,US,"Even before you smell it, you can tell this is a sweetie from the old-gold color and thick texture. Aromas of vanilla custard and crème brûlée, apricot preserves, orange-blossom honey and vanilla. Flavors are extravagantly fruity and sweet, with a honeyed aftertaste that lingers. It could use a bit more acidity to balance out all that sugar.",86,19.0,California
63360,Chile,"Spicy, green aromas suggest juniper bush more than clean berry fruits. This is firm and condensed on the palate, with herbal, minty flavors of leathery, savory blackberry and eucalyptus. The finish is saucy and herbal, with staunch acidity and hard tannins.",86,20.0,Cachapoal Valley
63361,France,"With its upfront, ripe apple and pear flavors, this wine is immediately attractive. Behind the fruitiness, there is a firm, structured character of minerality and a steely edge, which makes this a Chardonnay to age for 3–4 years.",90,65.0,Burgundy
63362,South Africa,"Fragrant notes of spiced plum, cherry and milk chocolate are met with toast and herbs on the palate. The acidity is a façade to smooth, sheer tannins and the finish is layered in oak and cocoa.",85,14.0,Stellenbosch

63366,US,"This is quite a value for the quality, a stellar, medium-bodied, restrained wine that's high-toned and elusive at first aromatically.

63368,US,"Smoky bacon and black pepper layer over generous yet smooth tannins, making for a somewhat didactic, intriguing wine, 100% varietal and aged almost a year in once-used French oak. Medium-bodied with an elegance of texture, it cries to be paired with meat.",91,28.0,California

63371,US,"For sheer palate seduction, you can't beat this rich wine. It used to be that Diamond Mountain Cabs weren't drinkable for years because of the tannins. Not so with this beauty. It shows pure, classic Cabernet flavors of blackberries, black currants, cherry-pie filling, violets and sweet, smoky sandalwood, with a distinct minerality. Although it's beautiful now, it should develop in the bottle for a decade.",93,80.0,California
63372,US,"A 100% varietal wine, this offers tremendous quality for the price, a well-crafted showcase for currant, cedar and bark that remains savory at its core. Grippy in tannin and contained oak, it's drinkable now but will benefit from time in the cellar, through 2021.",91,35.0,California
63373,US,"A big improvement over the winery's last release, this '09 Chardonnay is rich and oaky and crisp in acidity. It's just delicious, with ripe pineapple jam, buttered toast, créme brûlée and vanilla flavors. Made in a big, powerful style, but balanced. Drink now.",92,30.0,California
63374,US,"Blossom and berry notes are accented by hints of smoked nut in this refreshingly light-bodied wine. Zesty and lithe on the palate, it's an ideal summer-to-fall apéritif or porch sipper. The moderately long finish is marked with a hint of waxy florals.",89,18.0,New York

63377,US,"Gigantic, huge. Just erupts with the most intense cassis, chocolate and smoky new oak. Classic Howell Mountain structure, with dense, sweet young tannins and firm acidity. So immature, it's sappy and jammy now, and is sorely in need of cellaring. Don't touch before 2011, and should provide enjoyment for many years after.",94,75.0,California
63378,US,"Easily the best MacMurray Ranch Pinot Noir ever. Shows impressive depth and complexity, with rich flavors of cherries, red currants, cola, pomegranates, persimmons and smoky sandalwood, finished with tangy Asian spices. Tastes a bit jammy, suggesting a few years in the bottle.",92,60.0,California
63379,US,"A thin, sharp attack pushes subdued flavors of stem, cherry and chocolate into a quick, tight finish. In some ways, this wine recalls the Eyrie releases of decades ago, and may prove to age well, as many of those wines did. For now, it's a hard stemmy wine with a bit of burn.",87,80.0,Oregon
63380,Chile,"Good but common as Chilean Cabs go. It's a jumbled mass of bulky fruit, raw power, sweet oak and spice.

Finishes with spice and a hint of hickory. 20,000 cases produced.",86,12.0,Colchagua Valley
63381,France,"This vineyard is at one of the highest Castillon points. Big in tannins and also fruit, this is a dense wine. It has a dry core as well as rich blackberry fruits. Concentrated and full, the wine will be seriously worth drinking from 2019.",91,25.0,Bordeaux
63382,Chile,"Herbal and earthy up front, this blend of Cabernet Sauvignon, Syrah, Carmenère and Malbec brings notes of green tobacco and black olive to the front along with toasty oak.

It's fruity to the point of bomb, offering an orchard of ripe red cherries, raspberries, red plums, cola and something tropically sweet, like red mango.

The fruit is starting to dry up so drink sooner rather than later.",88,65.0,Tuscany
63432,Argentina,"Rather sweet and medicinal; the wine comes into form on the palate, which is fairly bright and forward as it pushes raspberry and cherry flavors.

63433,US,"Since its inception, Wölffer winemaker Roman Roth's namesake Merlot has been one of the best wines in Long Island. The 2012 bottling is no exception. It's a bold, densely fruity wine full of luscious black cherry, plum and currant flavors.

Delicious already but sure to improve through at least 2030.",93,44.0,New York

63445,US,"This Cabernet Sauvignon-based Bordeaux-style blend is very rich and ripe in blackberries, cherries and currants. It has smooth tannins, and the finish is dry.

63567,US,"A pure Syrah from estate fruit, this dark, peppery, earthy wine is saturated with color and ripe fruit flavor. From the Yakima Valley estate, it buttresses the currant and cherry fruit with polished tannins that add many layers of depth and nuances of earth and smoke.

63597,Germany,"Luscious green plum and white grapefruit flavors mark this taut, steely off-dry Riesling. While light in body, it's creamy in texture, filling the mouth with juicy fruit flavors off set by zesty, lime-inflected acidity. The finish is long and persistent.",91,38.0,Mosel
63598,US,"Despite its special designation, this is a dilute wine with thin fruit flavors. The core of green apple is accented with a hint of barrel toast (17 months in French oak, 29% new). The acidity seems muted. Drink up.",86,45.0,Oregon
63599,US,"Dusty mineral tones accent bright peach and apricot flavors on this slightly off-dry Riesling. Tart lemon-lime acidity lends brightness to the palate, extending a finish flecked with dried, savory herbs.",86,19.0,New York
63600,US,"Scads of sweet, fresh raspberries and cherries on this forward, fruity young wine. It's crisp in acidity and dry, with a lush coating of smoky oak. Would benefit from a little more earthiness, as the fruit is so powerful.",88,60.0,California
63601,US,"A richly fruity, tropical-fruit-scented Chardonnay that offers plenty of weight and fruit at a reasonable tariff. Bits of butter, dried spices and citrus accent the ripe fruit, which finishes dry and crisp.",89,18.0,California
63602,France,"Across the river Dordogne from Castillon, the vineyard of Lajarre is on the first slope. This soft and ripe wine has black currant fruitiness, fresh acidity and a judicious use of wood aging. It still shows the structure of 2010, so will be better from 2015.",86,35.0,Bordeaux
63603,US,"Smooth and silky, this seductive wine is absolutely loaded with flavors of cherry and chocolate. It's irresistible, and probably at or near its peak drinking window, as it affords maximum pleasure in a luscious, palate-coating style.",91,50.0,Oregon
63604,US,"For some reason, the winery held the '06 back later than the 2007. Maybe because it was so tannic. Still is, with a biting, palate-shutting astringency made harder by the wine's extreme dryness. But there's a place for tannic, dry Syrahs, and this is a very good one, with precisely measured oak framing deep, impressive blackberry, leather and black pepper flavors.",91,28.0,California
63605,US,"Juicy in ripe cassis and clove, this exuberant Cab with tamed, soft tannins explodes on impact. With a sanguine note to the background, the wine's oak is pronounced but in check, giving a plush impression.",87,26.0,California
63606,US,"Made largely of Cabernet Franc, this wine has all the elements of first-rate Meritage: ripe blackberry and blueberry fruit, accompanied by a blast of smoky oak. It tastes good, too, with pure, sweet, supple berry flavors; yet, it's very dry, with ample acidity. It lacks the focus of North Coast claret-style wines, but is certainly among the best of the genre from the South Coast.",89,30.0,California
63607,US,"Simple, straightforward and approachable, this fairly priced wine shows a depth of red currant, cherry and cassis alongside moderate acidity and subtle oak. It should please fans of lightly styled yet bold reds.",88,20.0,California
63608,US,"The aromas of melon, crème brûlée and baked apple are fresh and inviting. The palate brings sweet, elegant stone-fruit and kiwi flavors that extend through the finish.",86,12.0,Washington
63609,Italy,"Aromas of cedar, plum, toast, espresso and a whiff of blue flowers lead the nose of this Sangiovese blended with 15% Merlot and Cabernet Sauvignon. The ripe, straightforward palate offers ripe cassis, coconut, mocha and a hint of anise alongside firm, fine-grained tannins.",88,15.0,Tuscany
63610,US,"This is a Cabernet prototype from an up-and-coming vineyard. The brooding aromas of anise, cassis and barrel spice seem quite locked up at present. The black cherry and fine grained, highly structured tannins show an exquisite sense of balance that persists through the finish.",91,55.0,Washington
63611,France,"From the flagship Médoc estate of Bordeaux negociant Dourthe, this wine is impressive, ripe and ready to age well. The wood aging still shows slightly but that is already compensated for by the ripe black-currant fruits from the 66% Cabernet Sauvignon and the generous texture. Drink this wine from 2023.",92,49.0,Bordeaux
63612,US,"A touch of leather adds intrigue to bright cherry and fresh herb aromas in this Long Island Bordeaux-style blend, but hints of unripe stems lend a slightly green tone to the palate. Medium bodied in style with a refreshing spray of acidity.",84,50.0,New York
63613,France,"This Merlot-dominated blend has resulted in a wine that is both juicy and structured. With its forward flavor of black currant juice, it is surprisingly ready to drink, although the tannins also promise aging. It's ripe and dense, while the final acidity offers a fresh finish",88,37.0,Bordeaux
63614,New Zealand,"Only the second released vintage of this wine for Felton Road, and already the improvement is noticeable. The black cherry fruit is bold, the vanilla-laced oak assertive, and the overall impression is one of power rather than nuance. Maybe that will come with age.",90,60.0,Central Otago
63615,US,"A little light in body and flavor, with dried Provençal herb flavors and a hint of cherry. Does a yeoman's job of expressing basic Santa Rita Pinot Noir character at a price that's about half that of the top bottlings.",87,26.0,California
63616,US,"A strength of oak and burly black fruit in this single-vineyard designate makes it intense and big. In the background, an unexpected minty, forest floor quality overtakes the aromas at first, but blows off over time. The wine finishes as intensely as it starts, awash in toasty oak.",89,70.0,California
63617,US,"Herb, cherry, smoke, cedar, vanilla and coffee aromas are out front, with the Cabernet Sauvignon blended in (18%) showing itself. The palate is rich but well balanced, with coffee flavors lingering on the finish. It doesn't seem entirely varietal but it brings plenty of appeal.",90,28.0,Washington
63618,US,"A light earthy, toasted aroma and mostly savory rather than outright fruity flavors mark this medium-bodied, dry wine. The texture is smooth and rich enough to complete a good picture.",85,11.0,California
63619,France,"This small, seven-acre property has an unusually high (20%) proportion of Petit Verdot in its wine, giving it big color and structure. Ripe black currant fruits balance the tannins. Drink from 2018.",89,25.0,Bordeaux
63620,US,"A special spot for Syrah, Parmalee-Hill gets plenty of coastal fog and coolness, providing this gamy, silky 100% varietal wine with structure and buoyant acidity around a balanced weight of tar, black olive and dark cherry.",91,62.0,California
63621,Italy,Haermosa is made with organically-farmed fruit. It shows milky notes of peach yogurt and white chocolate. But it also shows zesty crispness on the close despite the thickness and fullness of the wine's overall texture.,84,28.0,Sicily & Sardinia
63622,US,"The Domaine cuvée spent 20 months in French oak, 30% new and another 30% once-used. The concentrated, well-ripened fruit sets up a chunky core of strawberry jam that plays nicely against defining acidity. It remains focused and pure through a driving, lingering finish.",93,70.0,Oregon
63623,US,"Cherry tomatoes, black olives, Kalamata olives, green olives, black pepper and dried herbs show on the nose of this zesty wine, done in a lavish not sparse manner. A rainbow of peppercorns pop on the palate, touching on the grape's herbaceous tendencies and showing tagine and tapenade flavors, but with tons of vibrancy and freshness. A well-done version of this flavor profile.",92,45.0,California
63624,US,"Lots of richness and a multi-layered personality make this deep-colored, full-bodied wine delicious and interesting too. It's a big red, with bold berry and black cherry flavors, an especially attractive texture that's velvety and firm at the same time, and a long, lingering finish.",92,65.0,California
63625,New Zealand,"This wine is widely distributed and often discounted, but don't shy away from it because of that—it's really well made. Subtle herb and citrus shadings mark the nose, but so do riper hints of fig and melon. Those riper notes shape the palate, giving it breadth up front, then gently tapering into a long, elegant, citrusy finish.",90,20.0,Marlborough
63626,Bulgaria,"This Bulgarian Pinot Noir has aromas of black cherry, red raspberry and cinnamon. In the mouth, there are flavors of dried black cherry, fresh cherry juice and brown baking spices before the pleasant, persistent finish.",90,17.0,Danube River Plains
63627,US,"A spectacular Pinot, continuing a string of great vintages from this little vineyard. The year 2007 gave California supernaturally rich but balanced Pinot Noirs, and this is one of them. It's sensational, offering broad, exotic fruit flavors, pinpointed with exotic spices, and exquisitely highlighted with French oak. Truly fine, this small-production wine should age over the next 6–8 years.",97,75.0,California
63628,US,"Violets, blackberries and espresso beans whirl together into a delicious, silky nose on this wine by Josh Baker and Matt Brain. It's similarly luxurious on the palate, soft and sensual with lots of boysenberry and olallieberry. It also shows a peppery licorice spice, boosted by focused acidity that enlivens every part of the tongue.",94,38.0,California
63629,US,"Coming from two area standouts—Lewis and Phinny Hill vineyards—this wine shows appealing aromas and flavors of shaved coconut, Mounds Bar, cherry and baking spices. The barrel influence is prominent but it largely stands up to it.",90,60.0,Washington
63630,France,"The wine is completely mature. With soft strawberry flavors that have melded into the rounded texture, this is a wine that has only the lightest tannins. Acidity and an attractive ripe fruit character make this a wine to enjoy now.",89,40.0,Burgundy
63631,Germany,"A fantastic bargain at $14, this nuanced wine balances heady saffron and spice notes against a backdrop of ripe mango and yellow cherry flavors. It's lavishly mineral on the midpalate, with striking lemon-lime acidity that drives an elegant, herb-accented finish.",90,14.0,Mosel
63632,US,"Aging may make this Cabernet more harmonious than it is now. It's a dramatic wine, ripe in blackberries and cassis, rich in oak, and with smooth, intricate tannins. Yet it's klutzy now, almost rude, like a gawky teenager who's growing too fast. Give it 4–5 years to mellow.",89,55.0,California
63633,US,"The most promising Pinots from this central Monterey County appellation, and this is definitely one of them, continue to show its promise. This is one of the few that goes beyond simple fruit and acidity into complexity. It's not an ager, but the raspberries and cherries, accented with acidity and oak, make it a fine partner now for steak, lamb, tuna or an elaborate mushroom risotto.",88,35.0,California
63634,US,"The flavors of this Cabernet are enormously rich. Blackberry and blueberry jam, black currant, dark chocolate and cassis come in waves. Few wines on earth are this ripe. The issue is balance and complexity, both of which could be stronger. Drink over the next few years.",87,40.0,California
63635,US,"Dried strawberry, black raspberry, cola, salted licorice and turned earth show on the nose of this wine from a vineyard in the Corralitos area near Watsonville. The palate is quite earthy and herbal, with dried mint, thyme, rosemary and graphite adding nuance to the cranberry fruit.",94,39.0,California
63636,Argentina,"Basic apple and citrus aromas are dusty and straightforward. This feels citrusy and fresh, with little to no oak. Flavors of nectarine, white grapefruit and orange finish firm and fresh.",85,11.0,Mendoza Province
63637,US,"Lots of leesy, vanilla richness in this New World-style Chardonnay. It brims with mango, orange and cinnamon spice flavors. Will satisfy fans of this sweet, creamy approach.",88,45.0,California
63638,France,"This dry Champagne forms a good contrast with the Brut Nature Rosé from the same producer. There is more weight to this wine, more richness and, in the case of this bottling, more bottle age. With its flavors of white fruit and toast, this wine is very ready to drink, with a rich aftertaste.",91,57.0,Champagne
63639,US,"This well-made wine is powered by lush red and black fruits and berries. The acids keep it lively and fresh, tannins are polished and the outstanding fruit is a real joy. It's unfiltered and aged in French oak, 50% new.",91,35.0,Oregon
63640,Argentina,"Spicy mossy aromas are cool and herbal, and with that there are grapy, toasty, and chocolaty oak scents. This Malbec blend is tight and rugged, with clampy red-bery flavors resting on that same chocolaty oak. Drying tannins make for a hard finish that should mellow in due time. Drink through 2021.",89,30.0,Mendoza Province
63641,US,"Dolan continues to produce stellar whites and reds from organically grown grapes in Mendocino County. This Chardonnay is ripe and full of minerality, a liquid form of crisp apple with vanilla on the finish.",88,18.0,California
63642,US,"Cut lime and nectarine flesh meet with orange oil on a lean and focused nose in this wine by Paso pioneer Gary Eberle. The palate is framed by racy acidity, with clean, crisp flavors of lime juice and green pear. The salty finish is mouthwatering.",88,22.0,California
63643,US,"A light, straightforward and focused wine, 100% varietal, this offers cranberry, mushroom and a complexity of tannin and oak. High acidity dances around fresh layers of strawberry and raspberry on the palate, with a grippy, cinnamon-spiced finish.",90,38.0,California
63644,Chile,"Fresh and composed, with aromas of asparagus, mineral and citrus. The palate is mild and balanced, with green-infused flavors that hint at bell pepper, green apple and garden-fresh herbs. Slightly pithy and peppery on the tail end, but honest as Casablanca SBs go. Good for quaffing.",86,12.0,Casablanca Valley
63645,Chile,"Definitely shows its Leyda roots via citric, oceanic aromas and flavors of crisp celery, bell pepper, grapefruit and mango. It's a bit softer on the palate than some coastal SBs out of Chile, but it's still full of verve and clarity. A very good wine that shows the Leyda style with Sauvignon Blanc.",88,14.0,Leyda Valley
63646,US,"A menthol/eucalyptus note shoots through the aroma of this pleasant Cabernet. It shows quickly maturing flavors of plum and pie cherry, an easy-drinking softness throughout the mid-palate, and just a hint of heat in the finish.",86,35.0,Washington
63647,France,"Orange-pink in color, this is ripe, full rosé. It has plenty of acidity as well as a crisp texture. The weight of the wine puts its firmly in the food category of rosé.",85,,Southwest France

63649,US,"A very finely crafted Pinot Noir, although it's also very young and wants some time in the cellar. Combines great Highlands fruit power and tannic structure with a silky, delicate mouthfeel. Beautiful now for the elaborate raspberry and cherry flavors, elaborated with beautiful oak, but better after 2013.",94,54.0,California
63650,US,"Malbec and Petit Verdot each make up 37% of this wine, with the balance in Cabernet Sauvignon. The Malbec pops aromatically, suggesting clove, spice and plum. The palate is well balanced, with supple black cherry flavors and a persistent finish. It brings a lot of appeal.",91,75.0,Washington
63651,US,"Here's a young, vital, impressive 100% Cabernet. It's dry, full-bodied and rich in classic flavors of blackberries, black currants, graphite and minerals, wrapped into silky tannins. Superb oak integration lends notes of vanilla and sandalwood. Just gorgeous in the mouth, filled with class and elegance. Now–2014, at least.",95,40.0,California
63652,US,"Light, spicy and well made, with pale fruit flavors of strawberry, cranberry and raspberry. Tannins remain stiff and peppery; the fruit does not seem to have the ripeness to fill out the middle, even with more bottle time.",86,24.0,Washington
63653,US,"You can think of this as a second label of Lancaster, the Cab producer whose estate vineyard the grapes come from. It's a pretty good Cab, strongly flavored and dry, with brisk tannins and a streak of herbs. The currant flavors taste a little overripe and raisiny.",85,35.0,California
63654,New Zealand,"The bold aromas are chili peppery, just hinting at riper fruit below, but the flavors are reversed, with peach and pineapple in the lead followed by peppery notes. This medium-bodied Sauvignon Blanc ends on notes of grapefruit and jalapeno; really good for the price.",89,13.0,Marlborough
63655,US,"Classic smoky, spicy aromas and complex fruit flavors make this dry, light-bodied wine from veteran winemaker Scott Harvey fascinating to taste. Its green apple, grapefruit and peach hints are accented with light floral, spicy touches. Vibrant acidity keeps it lively and appetizing with each sip.",91,20.0,California
63656,France,"87-89 Barrel sample. With its lovely fresh fruit, gentle tannins, spice and acidity, this is an easy, open, gentle wine. The fruit is ripe and floral.",88,,Bordeaux
63657,Argentina,"Clove and clam shell aromas are strange and not enticing. This feels grabby and scratchy, with a strong covering of clove on top of dry tomato and tart berry flavors. A raw finish is abrasive in feel.",81,8.0,Mendoza Province
63658,US,"Like all of Melville's new 2011 Pinot Noirs, this bottling is powerful and forward in cherries, raspberries and Dr. Pepper cola, alongside earthier mushroom and earth notes. It's a beautiful wine that shows the classy elegance of a well-grown Santa Rita Pinot, with brisk acids and firm but fine tannins. Drink now–2017 for maximum freshness.",91,56.0,California
63659,Spain,"Reddish in color and big on the bouquet, with sweet berry and cherry aromas. The palate is full and fun, with acidity and heavier, sweeter flavors of strawberry, raspberry and sweet plum. Handles its size well. Made from 80% Garnacha and 20% Graciano (for acidity).",86,10.0,Northern Spain
63660,US,"An absolutely lovely Pinot, the best in Gainey's long career. Dry, smooth and silky, it defines Pinot's more Burgundian side, with mushroomy notes along with perfectly ripe cherries and raspberries, accented with brilliant acidity. The oak treatment is tasteful and blends in seamlessly, offering a hint of toast. The wine treads an exciting line between ripeness and earthiness, while keeping alcohol to a refreshingly low 14.1%. This is a connoisseur's wine.",95,48.0,California
63661,Germany,"Lavish aromas of honeysuckle, peach and lemon abound in this vivacious, zippy Riesling. Dry in style, the palate is a bracing crush of white grapefruit and lime flavors that intensify through the long finish, accented by ripples of slate-like mineral.",90,17.0,Rheingau
63662,US,"Candied cranberry and grape meet with light nutmeg, gingersnap cookies and wet slate on the rich, interesting nose of this wine by Lompoc-based Brian Loring. The palate is power-packed and spicy, with boysenberry, sandalwood, cedar, incense, star anise and black-tea touches.",92,54.0,California
63663,US,"This blend of 43% Merlot, 26% Petit Verdot, 22% Carmenère, 5% Cabernet Sauvignon and 4% Syrah offers orange peel, herb, raspberry and spice aromas that don't seem entirely knit together. Dry tannins back up its blue and black fruit flavors.",88,25.0,Washington
63664,France,"The plateau vineyards that are the source of this wine give a cool, crisp and light character. It's fragrant, pure fruitiness, with a light minerality and citrus at the end. Drink now.",86,,Burgundy
63665,Chile,"Jammy aromas of raisin and baking spices are a touch herbal. This kitchen-sink blend of Cabernet Sauvignon, Carignan, Garnacha, Petit Verdot and Tempranillo feels rugged and grating. Classic Chilean flavors of reedy plum, berry and tomato end with a minty green note and a touch of fennel.",88,13.0,Cauquenes Valley
63666,US,"Here the high alcohol does not obscure the layered fruits and overall complexity of this exceptional Cabernet. Thick, ripe and richly endowed, it keeps its black fruit, ripe tannins and liquorous barrel notes all in proportion, and pulls in top flight fruit from Champoux, Sagemoor, the estate vineyard and other select sites. Earth, cedar and tobacco notes highlight the extended finish.",95,49.0,Washington
63667,Germany,"This dry, remarkably minerally Riesling highlights tones of granite and wet slate against a backdrop of fresh apple, lemon and tangerine. It's broad and textural on the palate, with sharp lime juice acidity and a hint of lemon pith and herb on the finish.",91,64.0,Mosel
63668,US,"Dilute, with simple strawberry flavors and a disjointed finish.",81,16.0,Oregon
63669,US,"Too big by far for a Pinot Noir, this single-vineyard bottling is heavy-handed. It has caramelized cherry and blackberry fruit flavors and a soft, candied quality. Ultimately, it lacks the elegance and delicacy of a fine wine.",84,48.0,California
63670,France,"A smooth and creamy wine—this is rounded and soft. The citrus edge is cushioned by a rich apricot and pineapple character. As the wine opens, it also develops a vanilla flavor, followed by a burst of acidity on the finish. Screwcap.",87,,Alsace
63671,US,"A lot selection; achingly dry but not just simple lemon juice. There's good concentration and a mix of mineral, rind, light citrus flesh, with excellent length and a finishing hint of honeysuckle.",89,25.0,Oregon
63672,US,"This wine combines 32% Petit Verdot with 28% Merlot, 26% Malbec and 14% Cabernet Sauvignon. It's intense in milk chocolate and blackberry-raspberry jam, high in acidity and low in oak, showing a tendency toward bitterness on the finish.",84,52.0,California
63673,US,"In a challenging vintage, this shows excellent structure around rather light fruit. Strawberry and cherry come into play, with some well-managed tannic strength from the addition of Cabernet Sauvignon, Cab Franc and a splash of Malbec.",88,25.0,Washington
63674,US,"Certainly a remarkable value, this brings concentrated flavors of ripe raspberry and cherry liqueur into a big, broad and deep midpalate. The exuberance and depth of fruit is astonishing, and the balancing acidity suggests that the wine will retain its freshness through 2020 and beyond. This is one to buy by the case.",91,18.0,Oregon
63675,US,"A great vintage for the Sundance Red, this is 43% Cabernet Sauvignon, 25% Merlot, 18% Cabernet Franc and 14% Syrah. The addition of Syrah really livens up the mix. It's a supple, sappy, sinuous red, with rich and complex cherry and berry fruits. The 30% new oak is not only lavish for a $20 wine, but it judiciously complements all of the good fruit.",91,20.0,Washington
63676,Chile,"Lean aromas of bell pepper and green fruits are not overly intense. This is linear, juicy and tight in frame. Flavors of lime, scallion, caper and dry cider finish racy and scouring. Good mouthfeel is a plus.",88,13.0,Casablanca Valley
63677,Argentina,"Pretty aromatics include balsam wood, blackberry and blueberry. The palate is lush but well structured, with bullish berry, chocolate and creamy oak flavors. Minty and super spicy and long on the finish, with a lasting dark toastiness.",90,25.0,Mendoza Province
63678,US,"This is one of the best red wines at this price in California. A Bordeaux blend with a splash of Syrah, it's so rich and opulent, it just dazzles from start to finish. Floods the mouth with sweet cherries, raspberries, milk chocolate and red licorice, yet gets structure from firm tannins and bracing acidity. Lives up to its name, a Cabernet-based wine to feast on with your favorite foods.",94,35.0,California
63679,US,"One of Brian Loring's always solid appellation blends, this one packs sour cherry and cranberry on the nose, with plenty of crushed sage and dried garden herbs, picking up more black cherry as time goes on.

63682,US,"High in acidity and low in oak, at least on the palate, and indeed aged in a majority of neutral French barrels, this wine is bright in lemon and green apple, with a suggestion of mango, falling somewhat flat on the finish.",85,43.0,California
63683,Australia,"This restrained, medium-bodied Cabernet Sauvignon is a solid value. On the nose, cedar, vanilla and cassis elements blend together easily, while brown sugar and vanilla flavors are supported by just enough cassis and black cherry fruit. Drink now–2028.",90,20.0,Western Australia

63687,US,"The assertive barrel flavors are still being integrated into the wine, but there is so much else to taste that it seems certain to knit itself together in the near term. Pretty blueberry and ripe cherry flavors are set in firm, toasty tannins.",91,32.0,Washington
63688,US,"About half Cabernet, the rest a Bordeaux mix, this opens nicely with forward plum and cherry fruit. There are notes of savory herbs in the nose, but the wine turns astringent and the finish a little chalky and stemmy.",86,28.0,Washington
63689,US,"This 100% varietal wine shows notes of raspberry and chocolate sprinkled with oak spices from time in 50% new French barrels. It's wound up tightly at present, packed to the brim with red fruit flavors and firm, slightly gritty tannins.",91,58.0,Washington

63692,US,"Principally blended from Abbey Ridge vineyard fruit, this offers red plum and cherry fruit, with a distinct streak of pineapple. Native yeast was employed, along with aging in one-quarter new oak, adding hints of Asian spices. The length and balance are impressive.",92,50.0,Oregon
63693,US,"Swirls of vanilla, sweet spice and cream cover more delicate flavors of yellow apple and pear in this yielding, richly textured Chardonnay. Sunny acidity and a ripe, rounded mouthfeel makes it easy and approachable in style. Drink now through 2020.",87,30.0,New York
63694,US,"This has creamy flavors of vanilla, honey, lime and orange.",82,10.0,California
63695,US,"Soft and ripe in extracted cherry and blackberry jam fruit, this also has some heat on the palate, the result of 15% alcohol. It feels a little simple, and the heat is off-putting.",84,25.0,California
63696,US,"This wine is made from 75% Sangiovese with 18.5% Cabernet Sauvignon and 6.5% Merlot. A little pruney, it falls flat and veers hot on the palate, full bodied and quite ripe. Dashes of cinnamon stick brighten the experience.",83,32.0,California
63697,US,"Big flavors, full body and assertive tannins balance each other to make this out-sized wine a winner. It has ripe black cherry and dried fig aromas, gushing fruit flavors and a broad texture, but the firm tannins keep it from tasting fat. It's hardly delicate, but definitely delicious.",91,50.0,California
63698,US,"A five-grape Bordeaux-style blend from the estate vineyard, this has lovely aromatics, as well as firm yet supple tannins.

63710,Australia,"Medium-bodied and a little viscous in the mouth, this value Chard is no fruit bomb, as are many others at this price.

63714,US,"Strawberry syrup, scarlet-red rose petals, warm licorice-laced cookies and dried sage combine for a brilliant nose from this reliably exciting vineyard, planted by a longtime cattle ranching family.

63739,Chile,"Plum and cherry aromas turn herbal and piney with airing. Definitely a leaner, sharper Alazan than in the past, with body as well as piercing acidity.

63755,Chile,"Quite the floral wine, with blueberry and violet aromas that distinguish it from others. But the palate is sharp and choppy, with high acidity that lends sharpness to the black cherry and raspberry flavors. Stirs interest because it breaks the mold of heavy, black fruit-dominated Syrahs.

63756,France,"This is a ripe and fruity rosé, with forward notes of lychee, rose water, peach gummies and tropical fruit salad. The palate is round and plump in similarly rich fruit flavors, with just enough acidity to keep it from feeling completely flat. Drink up.",84,10.0,France Other
63757,France,"Like many 2005s from the northern Rhone, Colombo's Les Ruchets needs time. The tannins dominate the mouth right now, but the black olive and peppered-meat nuances win out in the end, adding depth to tarry, leathery notes and plummy fruit. Try after 2015.",91,88.0,Rhône Valley

63764,Australia,"This is a dry, fairly full-bodied Riesling that's approachable now, but should hold well through at least 2024. It's fairly dark in hue for a young white wine, with smoky notes of grilled toast, honey and citrus that linger on the lip-smacking finish.",93,37.0,Victoria

63772,US,"Even in his less-expensive wines, such as this Columbia Valley Merlot, winemaker Charlie Hoppes gets excellent color extraction. Along with the color come stiff, substantial tannins; once in the mouth, however, the wine sets a different course, turning rather light and fruity.

63777,US,"Here's what a great estate does. there's no mistaking the pedigree, from the sumptuous, velvety texture to the exciting balance. It's class all the way from the elegant entry to the long, spicy finish. A hollow center says it won't age, but it's pretty nice stuff.",93,75.0,California
63778,US,"Generous in blackberries, blueberries and cedar, with a pleasantly meaty, smoky edge. Quite fine in its own way, but a bit angular at this time. Blame it on immaturity, and give this young Cabernet at least five years to mellow out.",90,48.0,California

63798,France,"As often with Magdelaine in recent vintages, this is on the austere side. Its firm tannins and structure dominate the fruit.

It needs another few months to settle in bottle.",91,,Bordeaux
63799,France,"Big, bold and rounded, this is a rich wine from a single vineyard. Red-plum fruits go with a plush texture that masks the firm tannins and dry core. The acidity and structure both promise long-term aging. The wine is still young, needing time. Drink this from 2022.",93,50.0,Burgundy

New French oak adds just the right touch of richness.",92,25.0,California
63829,US,"Ripe raspberry, slight minerality, mossy earthiness and a minty lift kick off this offering.

63862,US,"The vineyard is on Westside Road, in the warmer part of the valley. The wine is gentle, balanced and immediately likeable for its array of raspberries, cherries and cola. Heat from alcohol makes it a little ungainly, and may limit ageability. Drink through 2019.",89,58.0,California

63866,Spain,"Baked and heavy, this has prune, raisin and jammy berry aromas. The weightiness carries onto the palate, which is chewy and smooth. Flavors of blackberry, spice and jammy syrup lead to a finish with a chocolaty tone. Tasted twice, with consistent results.",85,45.0,Catalonia
63867,US,"Still tight and chewy, this lushly-fruited Syrah mixes berry and cherry flavors with earthier, mineral-driven bass notes. It will require a bit more bottle age to unwind and decompress, but it has all of the ingredients of a wine with staying power.",91,48.0,Washington
63868,US,"Spice, toast and savory dried herbs accent rich black cherry in this penetrating Pinot Noir. Dense on the palate and voluptuous in body, it's forward in fruit yet maintains a cool restraint of minerality and fine, penetrating tannins. It's a polished, memorable wine.",91,47.0,New York
63869,New Zealand,"Builds complexity through skillful layering of ripe black cherries, fresh greens (ferns or parsley stems), leather and earth.

Tart cherry and dusty cocoa notes on the finish and a fine sense of balance make it drinkable now or in several years.",90,24.0,Marlborough
63870,US,"Here's an edgy wine, a walk on the wild side. Explosive aromas of blueberries, crushed white pepper, earth and smoke lead to slightly sweet wild-berry flavors, packaged in very silky tannins, although the acids are fine. It's a big wine, making up in chutzpah what it lacks in finesse.",85,20.0,California

63874,Germany,"Dusty earth and mineral tones lend contrast to sweet, sunny tangerine and caramel in this feather-light TBA. The palate is persistent and pristine, awash in stone fruit flavors that pierce with laser-like brilliance. Delectable now for it's youth and fruitiness, but likely to develop mineral complexities for decades to come.",95,775.0,Rheingau
63875,US,"Failla reaches into this new appellation within Napa Valley for this vineyard-designated Chard.

63882,Italy,"This well-priced sparkler opens with aromas of toast, yellow apple, nut butter and a hint of honey. On the palate, fine bubbles and crisp acidity balance the pear, citrus zest and roasted walnut flavors.",89,13.0,Northeastern Italy
63883,Spain,"Mild peach and quince aromas come with zero zest or edge. This lacks shape on the palate and tastes jumbled, with bland peach and tropical fruit flavors. This finishes flat as a board, with almost no lasting flavor.",82,10.0,Central Spain
63884,US,"There is not a lot of differentiation between the winery's Dry Riesling and this one, which is listed as 10.5g/L residual sugar—barely off dry.

63926,Germany,"Crop yields were down substantially in 2010, so perhaps that is why so many of the top estates' entry-level wines are so exciting.

63927,France,"Dominated by wood, spice and almonds, this is a structured wine that moves in a straight line from its white fruits to ageworthy acidity and toast. It is still young, a wine that needs time to mellow, to move away from its tense fruit.",90,47.0,Burgundy

Those apple flavors, some of them fresh, some bruised, some baked, become the central theme of the lemon-focused palate.

It boasts thick, dense extraction, excellent structure and amazing persistence.",99,250.0,Tuscany
64034,Germany,"Pretty blossom and apricot aromas bolster ripe, rich flavors of honey tangerine and yellow peach in this forward, fruity wine.

64035,US,"A marvelous vintage for Freedom Hill, this high-acid Pinot is loaded with black cherry fruit. Rich, ripe, full, tart and penetrating, it might seem one-dimensional at first, but it has such excellent focus and depth that the fruit simply rocks.

64090,US,"This wine is composed of near equal parts Idaho, Washington and California fruit. It starts out a touch reduced, with black currant and sugared-plum aromas. It drinks a hair off dry, which offsets a dry lick of tannins. It's eponymous pairing should work perfectly.",86,11.0,America

64096,US,"A pleasant rose-petal pink in color, this wine by regional sparkling veteran Norm Yost shows red-grapefruit pulp and skin, lime spritz and a shred of bubble gum on the nose, playing both on hedonism and restraint. It's extremely refreshing once sipped, with more lime and pink grapefruit zest.",92,42.0,California

64099,US,"This 100% Cabernet is a blend of the winery's S.L.V. and Fay vineyards, and one of the most famous bottlings in Napa Valley. But the 2010 simply is not in the same league of past bottlings.

64103,US,"This blend of Cab Sauvignon, Cab Franc and Merlot is young, rambunctious and tight, but also very interesting. The aromas of chocolate, clove, pepper and black plum do the trick: you are drawn in.

Based on how this wine responded to air we say give it a few years to settle down.",90,30.0,Washington

Veins of anise, cola and clay add complexity, as the details expand into a lingering finish. Drink 2015–2030.",94,75.0,Oregon
64112,US,"This blend of Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot and Sangiovese is much drier, more acidic and earthier than many other Napa reds. Therein lies its strengh and its weakness.

Drink now with rich Italian-inspired fare.",87,65.0,California

Altogether, this is a mellow, subdued wine.",87,21.0,California

64122,US,"Interesting and distinctive, this draws upon old vines and a (relatively) high elevation site to extract unusual nuances.

64129,Australia,"The Shaw and Smith M3 Chardonnay continues to be a reliable performer, with the 2007 showing more restrained oak influence than in the past. It's still smoky and toasty upfront, but backed by ample apple and citrus fruit, and on the palate there's more of a toasted-grain note rather than overt vanilla and spice. Acids are crisp, elegantly extending the finish.",91,41.0,South Australia
64130,New Zealand,"This is a bit austere and linear, but the tradeoff is that it's refreshingly brisk and long on the finish. Tart citrus—think grapefruit—forms the core of the wine, garnished by hints of struck flint.",89,15.0,Marlborough

64239,US,"Super-fruity, with intensely concentrated blackberries, cassis and milk chocolate, while the oak is very heavy in sweet caramel and buttered toast. Not showing much now beyond sheer power. Could develop, but it's risky.",86,95.0,California
64240,France,"With some richness, red fruits over wood and a full-bodied structure, this is a solid, dense wine. Acidity is present, while the ripe juicy fruits more than balance it. The tannins offer a firm structure and suggest aging.",90,34.0,Burgundy
64241,France,"This blend of Merlot and Cabernet Sauvignon is full of black currants, rounded berry fruits and some solid tannins. The fruit dominates, spicy and fruity with final acidity. It is both drinkable from 2016 and worth aging until 2018.",90,23.0,Southwest France
64242,Chile,"Pungent stony citrus aromas include a distinct whiff of passion fruit. This feels tight, crisp and elegant on the palate, while slightly salty citrus flavors suggest grapefruit and sea brine. A briny finish retains snap and freshness.",89,20.0,Aconcagua Costa
64243,US,"Within an immensely heavy bottle lies a Chardonnay dark-golden in color and with barrel-fermentation written all over its body, which is hearty and nonlinear. The flavors tend toward coconut, pineapple and dried apple, concentrated and extracted in a big California way.",84,37.0,California
64244,US,"This highly concentrated, richly ripe red explores notions of plum, black cherry and tobacco. It finishes with a mildness of dried herb.",86,25.0,California
64245,US,"Crisp red cherry and berry notes on the nose become increasingly ruddy and ripe on the palate of this soft, medium-bodied Merlot. It's pleasantly juicy, but whiffs of ramp and dried savory herbs are a distracting contrast.",85,17.0,New York
64246,US,"This is a lovely, lighthearted vineyard-designated wine. Soft, layered and decadent on the palate, it offers a mix of green apple, Meyer lemon, ginger and marshmallow. Intense on the finish in savory, briny fennel, it sees only 20% new oak and is structured enough to hang out in bottle a few years more.",90,38.0,California
64247,Italy,"This wine offers aromas of overripe black plum along with notes of bell pepper and a hint of prune. The palate opens with black currants, raisin and cherry but then falls apart almost immediately. It's rather evolved and diluted, with dusty tannins.",86,35.0,Tuscany
64248,US,"Starts with an explosion of crushed white pepper and roasted, charred notes, with a suggestion of blackberries. Drinks round, soft and flavorful, a full-bodied red with velvety tannins and fresh acidity. This flattering, dry wine is versatile and easy to drink.",87,20.0,California
64249,Spain,"With almost no color, this spritzy rosado is prickly and feline on the nose, like Sauvignon Blanc or Verdejo. The palate is lightly bubbly, with bounce and tart tangerine and herbal flavors. Txomin Etxaníz has never made a commercial rosé prior to this. This makes you wonder why they did.",83,25.0,Northern Spain
64250,US,"Clumsy, with outsized acidity and sweet, jammy raspberry, orange and cherry flavors. Tastes sweet and sour, like a Chinese pork sauce. Contains too many different varieties to list, but they include Muscat.",84,38.0,California
64251,US,"With the largest production in the entire Northwest, it is important that this wine express clean, varietal flavors with characteristic brightness and focus. And it does. Lightly herbal, fresh and clean, its fruit flavors suggest lemongrass, orange and ripe apple. Excellent balance and persistence",88,10.0,Washington

64254,US,"There's a lightly spritzy tickle in the mouth, and a metallic undertaste to this Chardonnay. The blend includes 5% each Pinot Gris and Sauvignon Blanc, all done in stainless steel. Thin and a bit green, it does not quite come together.",83,12.0,Washington
64255,Chile,"Staunch herbal aromas of tobacco, olive, rubber, vanilla, cedar and wild berry are 100% Chilean. This Carmenère-led blend feels fleshy but alert, with tomato-based acidity. Saucy, herbal, tomatoey plum and red-currant flavors finish herbal and briny, with snappy tartaric acidity.",88,25.0,Maule Valley

64258,US,"Refreshingly mineral, yet deeply concentrated in red fruit, this wine is a standout amidst a growing contingent of quality New York rosé.

64269,New Zealand,"Making top-flight Marlborough Pinot Noir wasn't easy in 2014, so this is an especially notable effort from Kevin Judd. Classic savory, forest-floor notes frame black-tea and plum flavors in this concentrated, richly textured wine. Drink now–2022.",92,39.0,Marlborough

64271,US,"Bing cherry, sweet vanilla and sawdust aromas ring on the nose of the first Merlot bottling from the winery. True to the variety, the palate shows ample plushness and mild tannins, with juicy red plum leading the way. This accessible red could be easily enjoyed solo.",86,23.0,Virginia

64274,New Zealand,"Possibly just in a sullen phase, this reserve bottling from Craggy's home vineyard is dominated for the moment by smoke and cedar on the nose, and while there is some cherry fruit apparent in the mouth, it doesn't appear to be fully expressing itself. The impression is of a wine that's tightly coiled and may yet improve with another year or two of aging.",89,70.0,Martinborough
64275,Chile,"Usually Natura is better than this; this hot-vintage wine shows animal notes, spice and jumpy plum and cherry aromas. It's edgy and raw in feel, with hollow, green-leaning flavors and minty oak. An echo of green rattles across the finish.",83,11.0,Rapel Valley
64276,US,"Fresh and light aromas of lemongrass, Pink Lady apples, guava soda and a hint of pineapple make for a slightly tropical but clean approach to this bottling. It's fresh on the sip with spritzy acidity and more tropical flavors of guava, mango, pineapple and tuberose.",88,20.0,California
64277,US,"Solidly in the big fruit, big tannin, high alcohol style of past Barrister reds, this has a pruney quality that hints at almost-too-ripe fruit. The astringent, blocky tannins are somewhat mitigated by sweet baking spices from aging in 90% new French oak.",86,31.0,Washington
64278,US,"Almost overripe, this Cab has deep flavors of black currants that veer into prunes and raisins. It's a very dry wine, and soft in acidity, which makes it feel a little flat. Drink now.",84,80.0,California

64280,US,"There's an inkling of Petite Sirah in this Cab-driven blend, an easygoing wine that's soft and enjoyable, with characteristics of herb, clove and black pepper. The fruit side of the equation is populated in black cherry and berry.",85,45.0,California
64281,US,"This wine seems disjointed at present with notes of green herbs, leather, cherry and orange peel. The cherry flavors have good density and richness along with tart acidity but the dry, scratchy tannins distract. Give it extended time in the bottle or a very long decant.",88,90.0,Washington
64282,US,"No vintage is listed on the label, but the winery says the grapes are all from 2013. This rough and tumble, 50/50 Merlot and Tempranillo blend shows flavors of dirt and mushroom, with light and generic red fruit.",82,24.0,Oregon

64286,France,"Very firm and closed up, this wine is a tough proposition at the moment. It has the weight to develop well along with richness. Acidity, sweet fruits and concentrated tannins will all come through strongly as the wine matures. Drink from 2020.",94,80.0,Bordeaux
64287,US,"Very forward and mouth-filling in pineapples, mangoes, nectarines, guavas and figs. Yet the wine is dry and crisp. Shows flamboyance rather than complexity, and will appeal to fans of this hedonistic style.",87,47.0,California
64288,Italy,"Aromas of white flower, herb and apricot lead the nose. Made solely with Chardonnay, the palate delivers yellow apple, citrus and roasted nut paste alongside a soft mousse. Bitter walnut marks the finish.",87,48.0,Lombardy
64289,France,"Solid and firm tannins give this wine its structure. The fruits are masked by this density although the weight suggests they are there. It is concentrated and firm, and needs plenty of time. Drink from 2022. Founded in the 13th century by Benedictine monks, Château Carbonnieux is one of the oldest estates in the Bordeaux region. In 1956, Marc Perrin purchased the château and began vineyard and winery renovations, continued by son Antony. The property is now run by grandsons Eric and Philibert.",89,,Bordeaux
64290,Chile,"A dry, earthy bouquet with leather, spice and typical Chilean herbal-berry aromas leads to a concentrated palate with creamy oak and earthy weight counteracted by firm tannins. Flavors of baked blackberry, cassis, nutmeg and herbs finish with cinnamon, licorice and raw oak notes.",88,15.0,Maipo Valley
64291,US,"Just under five years in age, this wine's Cabernet Sauvignon-dominant profile shows through its full-bodied mouthfeel, dense tannins and cassis flavor. It's a big, new-oaky wine that's forward with concentrated fruit through the finish. A bit of a show-off now, it should benefit from 5–6 years in the cellar.",89,50.0,California
64292,France,"Crisp and grassy, this is a classic herbaceous Sancerre. It is tight, bright and full of citrus fruits. Grapefruit dominates, cut through with acidity and the freshest aftertaste. Drink now.",86,,Loire Valley
64293,Italy,"This 100% Cabernet Sauvignon from Jacopo Biondi Santi's Maremma estate is open-knit and sweet. Some creamy oak and loads of red raspberry make for an extremely cheerful wine, but one that doesn't have the tight grip and structure generally associated with varietal Cabernet.",89,45.0,Tuscany

64296,Chile,"Smooth, tropical and pure on the nose, with pineapple as the lead fruit. The palate is solid and full-bodied, with pineapple, papaya, honey and toasted flavors. Not “oaky” but it is well oaked, and thus the finish is warm, toasty and creamy. Drink now.",89,24.0,Casablanca Valley

Light and refined, its finish is dusted in pine leaves.",93,49.0,California

64307,US,"This is a big, gutsy, muscular Merlot marked by hard, dry tannins. That doesn't mean it's not rich. It is, in black cherries, black currants, mocha and oak, but it remains a tough, hard wine despite being nearly six years old. Not going anywhere.",85,45.0,California
64308,US,"Almost deep enough in color to be a red, this pleasantly dry wine made from Barbera and Mourvèdre grapes smells and tastes like raspberries, and is on the light side in terms of body. Drink it up before the next vintage comes out.",87,14.0,California
64309,US,"Sourced from the Gamble Ranch in Oakville, this is a fleshy, full-figured wine, floral in honeysuckle and voluptuous in youthful oak. Gravensteins apple is overtaken by the richness of butterscotch and tropical pineapple before a brightness comes to life on the finish.",88,48.0,California
64310,France,"The wine is structured and concentrated, showing a strong sense of minerality. Citrus and ripe apple fruits are complemented by richer apricot, always cut through with acidity and a tense texture. It needs to age, drink from 2016.",90,72.0,Burgundy
64311,France,"While the wine does have some dry tannins, it is surprisingly light and soft for a Nuits-Saint-Georges. Red cherry flavors are already as important as the acidity and the dry core. That means this is not a wine for long-term aging, so drink from 2017. This is one of the first vintages since Labouré-Roi, which was hit by scandal in 2012, passed into new ownership.",87,45.0,Burgundy
64312,France,"91–93. Barrel sample. This is a solid wine showing chunky richness that chimes with the black fruit of the vintage. It's full and ripe, but still shines with fresh fruit character.",92,,Bordeaux
64313,Argentina,"Concentrated and woody smelling, this ripe Cabernet is cut from the modern mold, meaning it's weighty and fully oaked. As for mouthfeel, expect severe tannins but also cuddly depth. Flavors of roasted, earthy berry fruits and cassis finish with oaky flavors of cocoa and mocha as well as herbal notes. Drink this integrated Cab through 2021.",92,90.0,Mendoza Province
64314,Chile,"Aromas of hickory and woodsmoke transition to maple, baked blackberry and cedar upon airing. This five-grape blend is led by Cabernet Sauvignon, but Carmenère and Malbec are major players as well. Expect a full-force palate with big tannins and layering. Flavors of hickory, savory berry and barbecue notes match the nose, while the finish is roasted, toasty and meaty in nature. Hold until 2016, then drink through 2022.",93,100.0,Colchagua Valley
64315,France,This tough wine seems light on fruit. It is hard and shows considerable extraction.,83,15.0,Bordeaux
64316,US,"Very rich, ripe and bold, in the way of Pisoni Vineyard Pinot Noirs, with mouth filling cherry, raspberry, red plum and mocha flavors, enhanced with smoky oak.

64319,Chile,"Scattered aromas of horseradish, cotton candy and vinegar are all over the map but don't convey varietal character or purity. This new wine from terraced vineyards in deep, rural Maule feels clipped, with heavy tannins. Mixed berry flavors are bitter and rubbery, and the finish is grabby and awkward. This is a first release; suffice it to say it needs more work to justify its price.",84,100.0,Maule Valley

64325,France,"This grand wine is stylish and elegant. It is also powerful and dense with dark tannins and great concentration.

It has a lot of textural appeal, with lightly chalky tannins providing support.",91,50.0,Washington

64330,US,"A blend of 53% Cabernet Sauvignon, 24% Malbec and 23% Syrah, this wine displays a strong tannic backbone, a burly strength of character and deep, dark black fruit.

64331,France,"Matured in large wooden vats, this is a wine that is so ripe and rich. With great fruit allied to an opulent texture, it is both spicy and full of tropical fruit flavors. At the moment, it is just bursting with fruit and will need time to calm down, so wait to drink until 2019.",93,65.0,Loire Valley
64332,US,"Baer's Arctos blend is about three fifths Cabernet Sauvignon, and here the grape shows less fat, and more structure than in the previous vintage. It's a better wine, sleek and yet fruity, with a pleasing mix of blackberry and cassis. The tannins are forceful, herbal, and sturdy, giving the finish a firm spine. The grace notes of clove and coffee and loam continue to add interest as the wine lingers through a dense finish.",93,41.0,Washington

64572,US,"After helping Liquid Farm launch to Chardonnay success, the Dragonette crew took their own stab at making the white grape, and have succeeded wildly.

64573,Austria,"Spicy white pepper pervades this rich, rounded red. Structured tannins call for meat if this is to be drunk now. These will mellow by 2016 in cellar and the ripe, crunchy red fruit will come to the fore.",92,75.0,Burgenland
64574,US,"This is a rich, dense Pinot, with blackberries, sweet cloves, allspice, gingerbread and nutmeg aromas.

64579,US,"Sourced from some of the oldest and best blocks, dating back to 1983, this brings whiffs of saddle leather across supple, savory fruit. Taut and tannic, it needs plenty of breathing time, which brings in black cherry and dark chocolate.",89,35.0,Oregon
64580,US,"Castle Rock again surpasses expectations with this Columbia Valley Cabernet Sauvignon.

64581,US,"There's an impact of treacly grenadine-strawberry on the nose of this wine that suggests full-bodied ripeness, but on the palate it underwhelms in light, diluted flavor and texture. The finish is short.",84,25.0,California
64582,US,"A sound, good Chardonnay that offers popular flavors made in the modern way. The wine is soft and dry, with ripe notes of pineapples, pears, buttered toast and butterscotch.",85,32.0,California
64583,US,"A blend of 69% Cabernet Sauvignon, 21% Malbec and 10% Petit Verdot, this carries aromas of fresh tar, blackberry and vanilla.

The finish is seductive with its lingering notes of mocha and dark berry compote.",88,48.0,Virginia
64584,Argentina,"Foxy and jumpy smelling at first, with brambly raspberry aromas. The palate feels heavy and baked, with grabby tannins in support of herbal, mildly weedy berry fruit flavors.

64591,US,"Exotic richness defines this lovely young wine. It displays the tannin-acid balance you expect from Anderson Valley Pinot Noir, plus the exceptional intensity of fruit characteristic of the vintage.

64599,US,"The 2008 vintage in California was the last really hot one before the recent series of cooler years, and this Cabernet tastes like it developed raisin and prune juice flavors in the heat.

64600,US,"From the Barton family's estate vineyard, this is a very dark Syrah with aromas of blackberry, balsamic, lavender and thyme flowers.

64613,US,"Blackberries and some funk in the nose: earth, leather, even a whiff of banana. Dark chocolate and an interesting citrus element add character to the standard berry fruit in the mouth.

64614,Germany,"While the nose is austere, suggesting more stone than fruit, the palate of this dry-style Riesling offers loads of juicy, sunny peach and apricot flavors. It's an approachable yet elegant wine with cutting acidity and a lime-pith finish. Drink now through 2021.",90,17.0,Pfalz

64630,US,"Fruit from this Willamette Valley sub-AVA usually shows an herbal side, and here it is nicely melded into a fruit mix of melon, berry and pear.

64633,US,"This is a big, rich, somewhat heavy Pinot Noir, stuffed with flavors of raspberry and cherry pie, red licorice and oak. It's impressive for its sheer volume, with zippy acidity that helps balance the high alcohol. It needs a few hours in the decanter to round off the edges, and it should hold in the bottle for several years.",89,55.0,California
64634,US,"For the first time this reserve-level Gamache Cabernet includes grapes from the Ciel du Cheval vineyard as well as both the Champoux and estate vineyards. It's 100% varietal, drawing upon equal portions of fruit from all three, and it's a magnificent combination.

Highlights of black tea, espresso and smoke add layers of interest to a lengthy finish.",93,55.0,Washington
64635,US,"This is tight when first opened, with a hard-edged herbal character. Beneath that shell are richer, tropical fruit flavors of ripe banana, yellow apple and a hint of papaya; and with plenty of breathing time the wine softens and opens out. Roughly two thirds of the barrels were new French oak; and that is still being resolved into the fruit. This wine has a good 6–8 years of life ahead of it, but if you are drinking it now, decant it.",91,30.0,Washington
64636,France,"Winemaker Julie Voirin has vines in Cramant on the Côte des Blancs. This wine, perfumed with wild flowers and freshly picked almonds, is ripe and fruity while having a crisp, mineral texture. It is well balanced, soft and ripe at the end, and ready to drink.",87,,Champagne

64651,US,"This wine is silky and well-balanced in acids and tannins, with judicious oak influences framing complex cherry, red currant and spice flavors.

It's a blend of two local Gaillac grapes, Duras and Braucol, which gives richness, structure and a dense, herbal character.

It has a tough, astringent mouthfeel, and the concentrated richness of grapes grown on low-yielding hillsides.

64676,US,"This compelling and distinctive wine is redolent with scents and flavors of sweet cherry and pipe tobacco. It punches up the palate and tickles the nostrils. Crafted from old vine Pommard (planted in 1973 and 1984) and cropped down to three-quarters of a ton per acre, this spent 14 months in 20% new French oak. It's one of those Pinots that requires your full attention.",93,65.0,Oregon
64677,France,"Although this youthful wine has obviously been in plenty of wood, it has the weight to reveal a promising future. So while the spice and toastiness are present now, they will soon integrate with the fine tannins and blackberry fruits. Drink this from 2019.",89,30.0,Bordeaux
64678,New Zealand,"Like Dog Point's 2011 Chardonnay, this wine is dominated by citrusy elements.

Drink now–2017.",90,40.0,Marlborough
64679,New Zealand,"This is a pretty, lightweight wine marked by peppery accents. Those give it an almost Syrah-like quality, although the weight and texture is all Pinot. Red cherry and spice flavors finish lacy and dusty. Ready to drink now.",89,34.0,Martinborough
64680,Australia,"It's a shame only the equivalent of one barrel of this wine was exported to the U.S., as it means only a handful of people here will get to experience it. It's perhaps the closest thing to great white Burgundy to come from Australia; subtly smoky at first, like grilled white peaches, adding hints of lime and vanilla on the palate. It's plump and slightly creamy in texture, but finishes with crisp, acidic verve. Drink now–2025.",94,109.0,Western Australia

64683,US,"This is a particularly lovely vintage of the popular Three Legged Red from Dunham. The fruit is a luscious bowl of cherries, with a streak of fresh peach as well.

64686,US,"Rich tannins give this wine a bracing mouthfeel, but it's still drinkable now. While it's a big wine, the palate feels -elegant and silky, with spicy flavors of black cherry and licorice.

64690,France,"While having the richness of the vintage, this wine also has all the steely minerality of Chablis. Its acidity goes in a crisp line from the yellow and white fruits to the wood. Still young, give the wine another 3–4 years. Screwcap.",92,50.0,Burgundy

64693,France,"The reticent nose gives almost nothing away but the palate fills with gentle flavors of shortbread and apple peel, of slightly bitter grapefruit zest and of sprays of citrussy freshness dispersed by a lively, fine-fizzing mousse.

It's an aromatic, tightly woven gem, loaded with plum, berry and kirsch, highlights of herb and bramble and a finish streaked with chocolate, espresso and licorice. Tannins are polished and the flavors linger delightfully.",92,35.0,Oregon

64707,US,"Winemaker Rachel Silkowski takes cues from her mentor Brian Loring in her debut wine, which is brawny and lavish with nose-ticklingly spicy aromas of cloves and nutmeg laid across black plum, olallieberry and violets. Baked black plum and black peppercorn are lifted by Christmas spices galore, from allspice to dried ginger. It's an attention grabber.",93,42.0,California
64708,US,"A succulent Pinot Noir, rich and ripe in cherries, tart cranberries, orange zest and Dr. Pepper cola, with sweet, smoky notes from oak barrel aging. The tight tannins and zesty acids together suggest midterm aging. Should hit its stride after 2013.",91,36.0,California

64714,France,"A dark-colored wine, smoky and toasty, perhaps too much. It has weight, with shafts of fruit coming through the wood dryness. The main wine of the château is better balanced than this special cuvée.",89,,Bordeaux
64715,Argentina,"Aromas of leather, graphite, saucy berry and tomato are good but not necessarily inviting. This high-elevation Cabernet is bouncy in feel and solid in structure.

64717,France,"This is a big, bold wine with superripe fruit. It is saved from great excess by its tannins and acidity. It does have some bitterness from the high toast wood aging. The wine should soften out to leave a rich fruity wine. Drink from 2021.",90,,Bordeaux

64721,France,"You need to think ahead here, because this wine is currently totally dominated by wood. The richness and classic, balanced structure that is normal with Haut-Bailly seems to have been put aside in favor of a highly polished, toast-laden style. Search for the fruit and there is blackberry,spice and fruit tannin. But it's hard. Wait 10 years at least.",92,,Bordeaux

64732,US,"A powerful, almost overbearing oak influence makes this wine bombastic. Toasty, maple sugar and smoked bacon flavors come from heavily charred new oak barrels or oak add-ins. It has a very dark color, full body, plenty of tannins and a smoky, oaky finish.",85,12.0,California
64733,Germany,"Aromas of brioche and caramelized sugar waft amidst apple jelly and quince in this elegantly pétillant Riesling sparkling. It's strikingly brisk, but the mousse feels lavish and comforting. The finish is marked by a meandering salty tang.",90,42.0,Pfalz

64736,US,"A rich, interesting wine at the junction between fresh, primary fruit and aged, bottled character. The blackberries and cherries are drying out, turning earthy and mushroomy. Yet the wine remains vibrant and tannic. Will continue to age for many years.",88,40.0,California

There is a juicy finish, and the tannins promise long-term aging.",89,42.0,Bordeaux
64743,US,"Despite its 2.4% residual sugar, this is a tart, lemony wine that seems made to enjoy with raw oysters. The searing acidity is not for everyone, but if you like lip-smacking tartness, this has the depth and flavor to match it.",88,18.0,Washington
64744,France,"Aged in 100% new wood, this massive wine is full of dark plum and fragrant strawberries. It is also packed with dark tannins that give the wine a dry core.

64783,US,"This blend of 80% Merlot and 20% Cabernet Sauvignon, sends up toasty aromatics richly imbued with the scents of new oak. John Bookwalter consistently makes wines in this style, which in a cooler year such as 2010, can seem to mask the fruit. Give it plenty of breathing time and the blackberry and black cherry core will begin to emerge from the toast, mocha and coffee.",89,45.0,Washington
64784,Germany,"Hints of pine and forest floor lend a cool, alpine feel to elegant white peach and blossom notes in this dry-style Riesling.

64785,France,"This pale-hued blend of Grenache and Syrah starts off a bit confected, offering up scents of cotton candy. Yet it's less so on the palate, where the fruit resembles underripe melon and the finish is stony and less generous.",86,13.0,Rhône Valley
64786,US,"This Meritage blend is 60% Cabernet Sauvignon, 25% Merlot and 10% Cab Franc, 4% Malbec and 1% Petit Verdot, and barrel aged for a couple of years.

64788,US,"Named for a type of surfboard, depicted on the label, this dark, inky and leathery red wine is blended with 6% Malbec and 2% Merlot. Rustic and full of earthy minerality, it shares a juicy underbelly that provides welcome succulence on the palate.",91,42.0,California

64790,Chile,"Made for Oops by VIA Wines, this oddball Chardonnay features 14% white Carmenère, meaning there's red fruit (without the skins) added to the blend to give bulk and texture.

64802,US,"The dryness and earthiness of this Merlot are just fine. It suggests flavors of herbs, tobacco and leather, in addition to cherries. But it's a bit too coarse and unstructured to get a higher score.",84,28.0,California
64803,Chile,"Smells roasted and spicy, with an herbal, brushy character. Tannic and tight in the mouth, with pinching grip and flavors of herbal plum and berry. The finish turns up fresh tomato and drying tannins. Seems high in red fruit acidity.",86,18.0,Maipo Valley
64804,France,"Ripe and juicy, this is a wine with structure and fine, dusty tannins that give it density. The red fruit is juicy, perfumed and has the freshness of the vintage, bright and forward.

64809,Spain,"Like it's bigger sibling El Anejón, this Reserva from a warm vintage is almost one-quarter Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot in addition to Tinto Fino (Tempranillo). The opening of burnt earth, brandied cherry, rubber and herbal aromas is distinct. This feels a bit tough and chewy, with boysenberry, cassis, vanilla-cream and herbal spice flavors. A fairly smooth finish is young and vital. This should improve with aging. Best from 2019–2026.",93,91.0,Northern Spain

64821,US,"Winemaker Adam Lee goes big on this bottling from the vineyard planted by the two Garys (Pisoni and Franscioni), showing bacon fat, blackberries and graphite on the nose.

64822,US,"This is indicated as a reserve-level selection, but at the moment remains unfocused, and even a bit dilute. Tart fruits and tight tannins never quite fit together. The drying finish carries a hint of wet cement. Give this at least another year or two of bottle age.",89,60.0,Oregon
64823,Australia,"Daryl Groom has turned out a reasonably bold, intense Sauvignon Blanc that weighs in under 13% alcohol yet manages to avoid tasting malnourished or underripe.

It takes on savory aspects of coffee and clove as it opens.",90,60.0,California

64830,US,"Gentle whiffs of caramel and olive entice on the nose of this intensely ripe, nuanced wine. Offsetting the plushness of Merlot against more floral, herbal elements of Cabernet and Malbec, it's a deeply layered, satisfying sip. Fine, feathery tannins and an open fruit structure make it approachable now but it's solid enough to improve through at least 2021.",90,30.0,New York
64831,France,"It's hard to believe it's possible to buy this quality rosé for so little money.

64836,France,This estate is under the same management as the neighboring large vineyard of Larose Trintaudon. The wine is stylish with ripe fruit that is balanced with fine acidity.

64893,France,"Ripe and rounded, this softly textured wine has swathes of yellow fruits that are deliciously cut with lime and lemon acidity. The wine, with its touches of toast is balanced, promising a fine future. Drink from 2021.",94,99.0,Burgundy
64894,Spain,"Spicy reedy cherry and red-plum aromas open this high-acid sizzler from a cool vintage. Lean as a stick in terms of build, this tastes of raspberry, red plum and dry spices. A short but juicy and tight finish is ripping with acid. Drink through 2025.",89,32.0,Northern Spain
64895,France,"A big, rounded wine, its acidity a foil to the ripe fruit and dusty texture. The structure is chunky and corpulent, the fruit strawberry and red plum fruit packed tightly. It is still integrating, definitely promising some long-term aging.",95,,Burgundy
64896,Italy,"An innovative mix of Nero d'Avola and Pinot Nero, this shows balance and harmony on the palate. In terms of aroma, the Nero d'Avola overpowers the Pinot Nero, however. It's a bright, fruit-driven wine with freshness on the finish.",88,17.0,Sicily & Sardinia

Drink now–2025.",91,40.0,Marlborough
64899,Argentina,"Without doubt the most full and complete Chardonnay from Argentina that this critic has tried. It smells lush and toasty, with elegant apple and pear aromas. The mouthfeel is rich and balanced, while flavors of baked apple, vanilla cream and woodspice are endearing. Long and flavorful on the finish, and not overoaked. A serious Chardonnay to drink now.",92,115.0,Mendoza Province
64900,US,"Von Strasser continues to produce stunning Cabernets that are not only delicious when released, but ageable.

64901,US,"Subdued in oak, this bright intriguing wine does a nice job showcasing tart tangy flavors of green olive and green apple, while still maintaining a freshness at its core. It is moderately structured and teased in a twist of lime.",91,46.0,California
64902,US,"This wine is half Cabernet Sauvignon with the balance Merlot, Cabernet Franc, Malbec and Petit Verdot. High-toned aromas of dried herb, barrel spice and red and black fruit are followed by well concentrated fruit flavors. The tannins show considerably more grip than is often seen from this site.

64907,Chile,"Rusty and light in color, with a dilute, stalky set of aromas, this thin Pinot is dry, a touch bitter and largely fruitless on the flavor profile. A bland, lightly woody finish tastes stalky and not fully ripe.",83,12.0,Maipo Valley
64908,Italy,"Easily recognizable thanks to its elaborate bottle encrusted with Swarovski crystals, Diadema is a blend of Sangiovese, Cabernet, Merlot and Syrah. It shows dense black cherry, black currant and underbrush along with oak, coffee and vanilla. Reflecting the heat of the vintage, it's shy on freshness but the fruit is appealing.",89,100.0,Tuscany
64909,US,"Cassis and black-cherry flavors are at the core of this pure Cabernet. It's tight and tannic, with accents of earth and ground coffee. It's definitely a wine that should be decanted well ahead of consuming.",89,30.0,Washington
64910,Germany,"Prevailing lemony, citrus-cocktail aromas with hints of almond macaroons. Though medium sweet, it is lip-smackingly crisp and racy, with zesty citrus flavors following through on the palate. Moderately intense and reasonably taut, if a little austere.",89,25.0,Mosel-Saar-Ruwer

64914,US,"Almost indistinguishable from its companion Horse Heaven Vineyard bottling, the Columbia Valley Sauvignon Blanc also clocks in at a modest 12.5% alcohol.

64915,France,"A wine that is destined for good aging, with its mineral structure and toast flavors. It has weight and richness but equally it has intense pear and citrus fruits layered with acidity. Age for at least four years.",92,60.0,Burgundy
64916,US,"Another successful Cabernet from Amici, who turns to this esteemed vineyard for sourcing. It shows real pedigree and finesse, and it's instantly appealing for its soft tannins and complex cherry, red currant, cocoa and spice flavors.

64918,Chile,"Herbal berry aromas are dry and foresty, much like Loire Valley Cabernet Franc. This is superficially creamy and a touch sticky, but otherwise not that deep or dense.

64919,US,"Green, unripe vegetal flavors mark this Pinot Noir. It does have some decent raspberry and cherry flavors, but turns sour on the finish.",81,48.0,California
64920,US,"This is one of the best rosés on the market. With a pretty orange and copper color, the wine is dry, crisp and deeply flavored in fruits, yet feels delicate and subtle. The blend is Mourvèdre, Syrah and Grenache.",92,20.0,California
64921,US,"Comprised of equal parts sweet, toasty oak, brisk acidity and ripe tropical fruit and citrus flavors, this Chardonnay is successfully made in the popular style. It's creamy and rich, with a vanilla honey sweetness. Easily Ventana's best Chard ever.",88,32.0,California
64922,France,"This is a fat wine with light, juicy acidity. Honey and spice notes add interest to its broad melon and apple flavors.",84,12.0,Bordeaux
64923,US,"Very delicious and luscious, but no mere fruit bomb. It has the tannic-acidic structure and dryness to make it refined, but explodes on the palate with blackberry, chocolate, cassis, anise and sweet, smoky cedar flavors that are deep and long. Tastes important and first rate.",94,110.0,California
64924,US,"The aging program for this Syrah, which comes from a vineyard near the intersection of the Carmel and Salinas valleys, results in a solidly balanced wine.

64927,US,"Each Le Cadeau wine has a different consulting winemaker. Scott Shull (Raptor Ridge) made this generously toasty wine. Bright fruit flavors bring berry and cherry forward, though in this young wine they are not yet completely integrated. Give it some hours of aeration and it pulls together nicely, or cellar it until 2018.",90,50.0,Oregon
64928,France,"This is a relatively new Champagne for Gosset, which has traditionally focused on Pinot Noir.

64930,US,"A solid effort from a well-balanced vintage, this is whole-cluster pressed and largely fermented in stainless steel. A percentage went into neutral oak, and none went through malolactic.

64931,US,"Pristine black cherry and plum flavors are layered in swathes of savory dried herbs, char and coffee on this bold, big-bodied red.

64932,France,"Rich and dense, this concentrated wine has a fine, smooth texture that is ripe with red-berry fruits. The freshness of the vintage comes through in the acidity and crisp, taut texture.

64933,Italy,"This opens with aromas that recall underbrush, tilled soil, crushed stone, dried herb and menthol. The big, powerful palate delivers dried black cherry, licorice, clove, mineral and the warmth of evident alcohol. Velvety tannins provide the framework.",90,,Sicily & Sardinia
64934,US,"A nicely drinkable Chardonnay marked by vigorous acidity and creamy-smooth flavors of pineapple tart, Key lime pie and lemongrass. Good as an inexpensive alternative to coastal bottlings that cost far more.",87,18.0,California
64935,US,"Broad aromas of black cherry and black-tea spice make for a dark and full nose, which is enhanced by strong soil components of turned loam and gravel. Dark boysenberry and tart plum skins show on the palate along with more tea spice, making for a very full sipping experience.",93,65.0,California
64936,Italy,"This 90% Sangiovese, 10% Merlot and 10% Canaiolo Chianti opens with subtle blackberry and moist earth aromas. Morello cherry fruit dominates the palate, accented by baking spice notes and round tannins. Enjoy soon.",86,12.0,Tuscany
64937,France,"Made from superripe grapes from old vines that have aged on lees, this is a rich, concentrated wine.

64938,US,"This is still a little hard and tight, but shows great ripe red berry fruit and well-balanced tannins. Another Arbor Crest wine with a fine, fragrant bouquet, clean and bursting with fresh fruit scents. It was barrel aged for 20 months in 40% new oak, adding some strength to the tannins and hints of toast to the finish.",91,15.0,Washington
64939,US,"Blended with 10% Merlot, this wine sources grapes both from its famous estate, as well as from nearby Pickberry and Murray vineyards.

64940,US,"At first sharp and showing the influence of barrel aging in roughly 20% new French oak, this opens up and smoothes out into a supple, buttery wine.

Drink now–2020.",97,60.0,California

64948,US,"Soft and rather one-dimensional, this Cabernet shows ripe cherry, raspberry, blackberry and oak flavors. It's bone dry, showing herbal, astringent tannins. Could develop interestingly in the bottle over the next 6–8 years.",86,50.0,California
64949,US,"Aromas of coffee, fig, dried fruit and soy sauce are concentrated on the nose. Earthy flavors on the palate are elevated by these aromas, with a hint of Rooibos tea that gives it lift and intrigue. The tannins are silky and the finish is long with evolving flavors.",87,49.0,Virginia
64950,US,"Black fruit with a touch of prune and meat on the nose. Oak-lashed plums and currants in the mouth taste a bit burnt from the wood treatment. A woody express train, with lots of coffee. Fans of dark, structured, oaky wines will get a kick out of this one.",89,50.0,California

64957,Germany,"Loosen's Grosses Gewächs bottling from old vines is plump, custardy and slightly sweet-tasting, buoyed by ample ripe apple and peach flavors and tinged with hints of lime, fern fronds and crushed stone. It might well have been more impressive served in a different (sweeter) flight; in this context it seemed slightly soft.",87,42.0,Mosel
64958,US,"From blocks of old Wente vines planted in the 1970s, this producer and site continue to find beautiful synergy together. This wine shows high-toned floral notes around full-bodied richness and flavors of crème brûlée and anise.

64959,France,"One of the single-vineyard wines produced by Dauny, this is a wine with great freshness while also having a rich character from the southerly exposure of the vines. Still young, it is all tangy acidity and needs to age. Drink from 2016.",89,25.0,Loire Valley
64960,US,"Here's a vintage-driven wine that needs the right conditions to succeed, which 2006 provided with its long, cool hangtime. The fruit has ripened to perfection, offering deep flavor notes of blackberries and raspberries.

Great now, and should age for 4–6 years.",94,34.0,California
64961,Austria,"The first vintage of this great wine since 2003, this remains a wonderful example of the almost ethereal character of cooler climate eiswein (ice wine). The wine is certainly honeyed, but the freshness, the lightness, the poise, are just as important. If you can resist, age this wine for at least 5 years.",94,89.0,Niederösterreich
64962,US,"Hard tannins, probably from the grape skins, mark this wine, the kind you usually don't find in a Syrah, especially one from a warm climate like Alexander Valley. Beyond the lockdown astringency, you'll find lush blackberry and cocoa flavors, but they may not last long enough for the wine to age.",86,40.0,California
64963,US,"There's a bit of oak in this Riesling, just enough to give some mellowness to the tart apricot, citrus and white flower flavors. It's bone dry and acidic, with a mineral intensity that finishes with elegance and style.",87,38.0,California

64966,US,"This is dry, almost sour, despite its low alcohol, and feels disjointed. Along with the sour citrus flavor is a conflicting streak of too-ripe fruit. Interesting components, but they may or may not knit together with more bottle age.",85,22.0,Oregon
64967,France,"This fresh and flavorful rosé is as easy to like as its gentle price tag. There's loads of youthful strawberry and peach fruit, propped up by a bright line of acidity that carries the flavors through to a medium finish. Pick this for your next warm weather gathering.",87,11.0,Provence
64968,France,"From one of the top vineyard areas in Pouilly Fumé, this wine is rich, concentrated and with a great aging potential.

64973,US,"Ripe and bright flavors emphasize cherry fruit, deftly highlighted with touches of orange peel and fresh herb. New wood is lightly applied, just a couple of barrels out of 15, and adds a touch of chocolate to the finish.",89,60.0,Oregon
64974,Italy,"If you enjoy a really pungent, intensely grassy Sauvignon, then you'll love this wine, but for many consumers it will be too much. The descriptor “cat pee” may sound unkind, but it's apropos in this case, balanced by passion fruit and a long, lemony finish.",87,38.0,Northeastern Italy
64975,US,"This is very sweet in honey flavor, with fruity notes of apricot and orange. It could benefit from greater acidity to balance the sweetness, but it sure is a decadent dessert sipper.",87,40.0,California

64989,US,"Steve Dooley has championed this region since 1994, and this appellation blend is another strong argument. Aromas of sour tangerines, tangy pear, sea salt and hints of quinine are leveled by the slightest touch of brown sugar on the nose.

64994,US,"This wine deftly combines 52% Napa County Merlot and 33% Sonoma County Syrah with 15% Napa County Cabernet Sauvignon.

64999,France,"More structure and less fruit is the characteristic of this wine. A dry core is very present, giving a tough edge at this stage. There are the hints of red fruits and powerful acidity that will develop. With its weight, this is a wine for the long term. Drink from 2019.",93,,Burgundy
65000,US,"Medium bodied and fresh-tasting, this well-balanced wine emphasizes its apple and lemon flavors without much oak intervention. It has refreshing acidity and a clean finish.",88,28.0,California
65001,France,"The estate dates back to before the French Revolution. Today, it is run by Philippe Girard who has produced this delightfully crisp wine. Its acidity and its tangy texture show its youthful side. That needs to calm down and broaden out, so wait until 2018.",88,26.0,Loire Valley

65005,US,"With no oak, this wine's inherent fruit stars, showing citrus, melons and peaches. With crisp acidity, it's clean, brisk and entirely dry, despite relatively low alcohol. But it's strong in those perfumed pyrazines that turn some people off.",86,18.0,California

65007,US,"This ripe, lovely wine shows classic Russian River Valley aromas of ripe, sweet, green apples. The winemaking adds smoky, vanilla-scented oak, a creamy, leesy smoothness and a rich softness that owes to malolactic fermentation. What strikes you, though, is the balance. All the parts come together in this super-enjoyable wine. At this price, it's a great value.",89,15.0,California
65008,France,"Ripe and fruity, this red-berry flavored wine has good acidity and a crisp, bright texture. The tannins are now well integrated into the fruit, giving a structured, yet fresh, aftertaste. Drink now.

65012,US,"Solid fruit brings firm, taut black cherry and cola flavors to the front. This is a muscular, flavorful, somewhat blocky wine that brings Pinot Noir up to burger wine status—and you may take that as a compliment. Some barrel toast adds butter and almond to the finish.",89,26.0,Oregon
65013,Italy,"Made with Nerello Mascalese and a drop of Nerello Cappuccio, this offers earthy aromas suggesting ripe dark-skinned berry, tilled soil, game, truffle and leather.

65017,New Zealand,"This wine's expressive aromas and flavors of sweat, green herbs and passion fruit all speak of the Dillons Point subregion, but those excesses are toned down by aging in 1,000-liter oak casks known in German as fuders.

65020,US,"Although this Pinot is captivatingly rich in raspberry and cherry pie filling, red currant and Dr. Pepper cola flavors, it also has fine acidity and smooth, complex tannins, and a lovely overlay of sweet, smoky oak. Good as it is, there's no reason why it shouldn't develop bottle complexity over the next six years.",93,59.0,California
65021,France,"Tight and crisp initially, this broadens out into a ripe, full wine that is well balanced. A great swathe of tangy citrus and orange is offset by the more generous background of ripe apricots and spicy quince. Drink from 2016.",90,,Burgundy

65024,France,"Owned by the Rouzaud family of Roederer Champagne, this has become a model Saint-Estèphe. It has all the initial tannins that dominate wines from this appellation.

65025,Austria,"Citrus peel, naked rock and cold mountain streams are the images conjured up by the first whiff of this fine, featherlight Riesling. Sprightly and fresh, wired and zesty, it is a reminder of the bracingly fresh and thrilling 2014 vintage. This will provide supreme refreshment on a hot day but also keep its cool in years ahead. Riesling ahoy!",92,27.0,Wachau

65031,US,"Clear in color and texture, this is a refined and yet voluptuous wine, a blend from several of the producer's single-vineyard designates, from Ridgetop Vineyard near Annapolis to Gap's Crown within the Petaluma Gap.

65033,US,"This wine is half Funk Estate Vineyard Syrah, with the rest McClellan Estate Cabernet Sauvignon. The two varieties somewhat seem to cancel each other out initially, with aromas of smoked meat, cherry, herb and earth that don't seem fully resolved. The palate brings a smooth, elegant styling to the red and blue-fruit flavors. There's plenty of interest, but it doesn't all entirely come together at present.",89,55.0,Washington

The palate is silky and holds to a tight line of plum and blueberry skins.",91,55.0,California

65040,France,"Named after the daughter of owner Alain Thiénot, this Champagne comes from the Montagne de Reims. Full and rich, it is mature with toast and almond flavors as much as fruit. The vanilla flavor is balanced by the acidity and tight, zesty aftertaste. Drink now.",92,100.0,Champagne
65041,US,"A tremendous wine that easily merits being Barnett's most expensive release. Shows the ripe blackberry and black currant flavors and new oak that are so easily achieved, with yet near perfect tannins and a dryness unusual in a Cabernet this fruity.

65048,US,"This easy-to-drink appellation blend, which is 88% from John Sebastiano Vineyard and 12% from La Encantada, shows lively raspberry and pomegranate on the nose along with hibiscus flowers, rose petal, sweet sage and light pine forest aromas.

65054,US,"Compact and chewy, with clearly delineated Bordeaux style and character. Cassis and black cherry fruit; stiff, earthy tannins, good length and fine aging potential.

65058,US,"This gorgeous, concentrated, mouthfilling wine is delicious to sip now but will certainly improve in the cellar for a decade or more. Tempting black cherry and boysenberry flavors seem to swell in the mouth, while light baking-spice and black-pepper accents weave in and out. Even on the finish it keeps surging with dark fruits and spices.",95,40.0,California
65059,Germany,"Enticing scents of grapefruit zest and bees wax are fitting openers to this creamy, rich TBA full of luscious orange-marmalade flavor. Bright, brisk tangerine acidity adds freshness and levity to the palate, leading to a long, honeyed finish.",93,500.0,Rheingau
65060,US,"Dramatically rich and full-bodied in blackberry, cassis, dark chocolate and oak flavors. With thick, fine tannins giving it a youthful astringency, this Bordeaux blend needs to be cellared. Should develop bottle notes over the next ten years.",91,85.0,California

65066,US,"This hits the jackpot. You taste it and are struck by its incredible richness, but then the balance kicks in, making it all the more impressive. It shows intense mountain flavors of blackberry, currant and dark chocolate, which are set into firm tannins. New oak brings delicious layers of vanilla and buttered toast. So good now, you can hardly keep your hands off the cork, but it should develop for many years.",94,80.0,California

65110,France,"Crisp and grassy, this is a classic herbaceous Sancerre. It is tight, bright and full of citrus fruits. Grapefruit dominates, cut through with acidity and the freshest aftertaste. Drink now.",86,,Loire Valley
65111,Chile,"Jammy red-berry aromas come with a green streak. The wine is a bit hard in feel, with choppy tannins. Sweet blueberry and graham cracker flavors are offset by saline and green accents, while the finish is chunky and earthy.",87,25.0,Colchagua Valley
65112,France,"There is a smooth, wood-aged character to this wine, along with attendant firm tannins. Chocolate and black fruit show extraction and bring some bitterness. Austere at the moment, this wine needs time.",85,,Bordeaux
65113,US,"Opening with an earthy touch of compost and wild mint, this wine develops rich flavor within its broad frame of refreshing acidity, including savory touches of cardamom, cranberry and cola. The tension between fruit and texture gives it complexity and nuanced power in the glass.",92,60.0,California
65114,France,"Soft and rounded, this has plenty of warm fruits, but misses the acidity, crispness and texture. There is a pepper note on the finish.",85,,Provence
65115,Chile,"A bit of heat oozes off the bouquet, but it's mostly dense and sound, with blueberry, herb, tobacco and cola aromas. It feels tannic and rich, with baked berry, chocolate, prune and mint flavors. A five-grape Bordeaux blend that's jammy and New World in style, this is very ripe and a touch raisiny tasting on the finish.",90,27.0,Maule Valley
65116,Italy,"Made from a blend of Nero d'Avola, Cabernet Sauvignon and Cabernet Franc, the 35th anniversary edition of this iconic wine opens with aromas of earth, leather, black currant and bell pepper.

65117,US,"A beautiful Pinot Noir, light and silky in the mouth, with brisk acidity and a lovely coat of sweet, smoky new oak. The flavors show the pedigree of the vineyard, suggesting ripe raspberries, cherries, cola and red currants, touched with exotic sandalwood. Drink now–2018.",92,56.0,California
65118,US,"This standout wine has an extreme color that verges on black, while exciting aromas suggest wood smoke and grilled beef, with flavors so rich they could be chocolate. The wine puts those all together without becoming heavy or too stiff in texture, although it does have a flood of fine tannins that help layer in more fruit and spices as you sip. Best after 2019.",93,30.0,California
65119,New Zealand,"A fresh, fruit-forward style, this wine offers bold passion fruit and gooseberry flavors with just a hint of nectarine. It's not terribly complex, but the refreshing flavors linger nicely on the finish.",87,19.0,Marlborough
65120,France,"This is a fragrant, generous and ripe wine with apricot flavors and a warm character. It tastes of the sun, coming from a vineyard that faces almost due south. The background is never far from the more mineral character of great Chablis and this wine will keep this contrast as it ages. Drink from 2017.",94,,Burgundy
65121,Argentina,"Quite good and above the masses when compared to the bulk of rosé wines coming from Argentina. Made from Malbec, it's bright and floral, with a touch of citrus to the nose.

65123,US,"Very rich, ripe and dramatically textured, this has explosive flavors of blackberry, crème de cassis, dried herb and smoked meat flavors, enriched by smoky oak. It shows the tough, hard tannins you often find in low production mountain Cabernets. Made by the well-known consulting winemaker, Philippe Melka, it has the structure of a wine that needs age. Give it at least eight years, and it could be one that lasts decades.",94,125.0,California

65125,US,"The fourth-generation family behind San Antonio Winery make this top-end bottling from the vineyard they planted. Aromas of dark red fruit, heavy black spice, tar and smoke hit the nose with promising force, but the palate proves quite tannic with sour and bitter cranberry skins. This has all the elements needed for a classic wine, but give till 2016.",88,40.0,California
65126,US,"The vintage was cool, lending this wine strong acidity that cuts through the mouth like a squirt of lime juice. Dry and austere, it offers oak-influenced sour-cherry candy and cola flavors. This should develop bottle complexity over the next 3–6 years.",92,55.0,California
65127,US,"This lively wine is fresh and bright on the nose, but not simple at all, with aromas of plump raspberry, pomegranate, rose petals, hibiscus and a hint of eucalyptus on the edge. It has tons of verve and pin-pricking acidity on the palate, where just-cut pomegranate, alpine strawberry and chopped thyme thrive.",94,45.0,California
65128,Argentina,"Char, clove and rubber aromas dominate what's otherwise leafy and herbal. A tight, hard-tannin palate features peppery, bitter flavors of black fruits in front of a pinched, narrow-feeling finish.",82,25.0,Mendoza Province
65129,Argentina,"Compact on the bouquet, with a pointed combo of boysenberry and blackberry aromas. The palate is full, with plenty of acidity and stuffing.

Drink now through 2012.",89,18.0,Mendoza Province

65131,US,"The nose on this bottling is a tad fruit-punchy at first, with light red cherry and candied pomegranate aromas, but then picks up complexity with a leather note. The palate also offers that leather alongside tobacco and light elderberry fruit.",86,18.0,California

65134,US,"There are light and airy elements of nectarine flesh and lemon blossoms on the nose of this first Chardonnay ever made by veteran Doug Margerum, who also imparts warmer scents of toast and clarified butter. The palate is tightly coiled, simultaneously soft with stone fruit and sharp with chalky texturality.",93,48.0,California
65135,US,"Tangy cherry flavors are framed in smoky, oaky flavors. Licorice-like at the  end.",82,8.0,California
65136,France,"The nose is shy and does not give much away. On the palate, beautifully pure red currant and tart red-cherry notes come through. The slender body is pervaded by freshness and has lovely overtones of conifer and oak leaf. It is later on that the fine but firm structure comes to bear. This is light but has depth and the potential to develop.",90,25.0,Alsace
65137,US,"Still tasting like a very young wine, this opens with pretty fruit flavors that range from raspberry candy to dark layers of black cherry and cassis. The concentration and depth are apparent, though quite compact. The blend includes 14% Merlot and 10% Petit Verdot.",92,89.0,Washington
65138,US,"Rather dark in mauve colors and slightly cloudy, this wine by urban vintner Matthias Pippig offers rather heady aromas for a rosé, with smashed olallieberry, blackberry and a touch of cardamom spice. Once sipped, aromatic plum flavors ensue, with help from Turkish spices and noticeable grip.",89,45.0,California
65139,Germany,"A mixture of mineral and spice accompanies the lemon and apricot fruit in this tangy, focused Riesling. There's plenty of intensity and an energizing balance of fresh acidity and lingering sweetness. Drink now or age four to five years.",90,30.0,Mosel

65141,US,"A classic take on Merlot—this is 100% varietal, and was aged for 15 months in new and neutral French oak barrels and botti.

The midpalate is concentrated and full, with a fine, lingering, superclean finish.",95,70.0,Washington

65143,US,"Right out of the bottle, this wine is tannic and closed. After a while in the glass, it starts to soften, showing mushroom, cola, pomegranate and raspberry flavors, but it's still resistant. Give it until 2018, and it should gradually unfold for another few years afterward.",91,48.0,California

65147,US,"Visitors to Sonoma Valley are familiar with the beautiful Cherryblock Vineyard, which has been Sebastiani's flagship Cabernet source for decades. The 2010 vintage was kind to it, producing fruit that's not only exceptionally ripe, but well structured. Balanced acidity and soft, intricate tannins house luscious black cherry, currant, anise and new oak flavors. The wine should age in the bottle for at least eight years.",91,90.0,California
65148,Germany,"Earthy, savory aromas subside to reveal fresh lemon and lime on this elegant, steely wine. Off-dry in style, it balances ripe pear and apple flavors with a sturdy backbone of acidity. Finishes moderately long.",88,20.0,Rheingau
65149,France,"Packed with attractive red-berries and citrus, this is a warm and ripe wine. It is totally dominated by its fruitiness and by the Syrah that brings a perfumed character to this fine apéritif wine. Drink now.",88,20.0,Provence
65150,US,This Cab wants a few more years to let its internal inconsistencies resolve. The primary cherry and blackberry fruit has faded and is turning nutty. But it's still pretty tannic. Needs to throw some sediment to let the inherent fruit emerge. Try after 2016.,90,52.0,California
65151,US,"Opens with immense, luscious aromas of apricot liqueur, vanilla custard, fennel, orange blossom and honeysuckle. Explodes on the palate with enormous fruit and spice flavors; it’s intense and concentrated. Very sweet, but the acidity is high and cleansing. It has a velvety texture, and finishes long and sweet. Enjoy it with vanilla ice cream or crème brûlée",90,20.0,California

65155,US,"This polished, savory Pinot successfully navigated the difficult 2011 vintage, coming out ripe and clean.

Drink now–2019.",92,49.0,California
65156,US,"Silky and dry, but a bit harsh and raw around the edges, with some green, unripe flavors of mint accompanying the cherries and oak. Not likely to improve, so drink now, after a good decanting.",85,45.0,California
65157,US,"Rich in cassis and black peppercorn, grapes for this wine came from Stagecoach Vineyard as well as other Napa Valley superstar sources.

Small amounts of Merlot and Petit Verdot are blended in.",90,80.0,California

65160,US,"Cline's Oakley is more than halfway made up of Syrah, with smaller smatterings of Petite Sirah, Barbera and Cabernet Franc. The tinkering in the cellar works, the wine refreshing in strawberry jam, soft and rich with an herbal presence and kiss of vanilla on the finish.",86,10.0,California
65161,US,"Airfield reds are thoroughly saturated with color, and often quite tannic, to the detriment of the lighter, more subtle fruit. This wine loses its definition and turns from pretty to pretty harsh as a result.",84,24.0,Washington
65162,France,"A very concentrated wine with such a stylish feel. It balances ripe berry fruits with chocolate and wood flavors in the richest, ripest combination. The wine has power, without losing its poised character. It's ready for long aging.",97,170.0,Bordeaux
65163,US,"Clean aromas of black cherry, dried thyme and white pepper show that this bottling isn't just all about creative packaging, with its Grim Reaper theme. The flavors are also cohesive and well integrated, with nutmeg, clove and stewed red cherry working together.",88,,California

65166,US,"Made in a heavy, dense style, with extracted fruit flavors and lots of oak, this Cab is immediately flashy in chocolate, blackberry jam and toast. It delivers in richness, yet lacks a certain vitality. Drink now.",87,27.0,California
65167,US,"Sourced from two high-profile vineyards, Silver Eagle and Lancel Creek, both farmed by Ulises Valdez, this wine offers an intensity of earthiness on the nose. It otherwise is softly layered in waves of forest floor and dark cherry, with even darker undertones of blackberry and chocolate that rise on the finish.",90,65.0,California
65168,France,"Even Weinbach's simplest Rieslings are full of intense flavors. This wine is floral, with flavors of white fruits along with a racy, crisp acidity. It is complex, concentrated but essentially dry.",89,18.0,Alsace

65170,US,"With a motto of “affordable luxury,” Layer Cake sources Chardonnay fruit from the fringes of pricey appellations. In this case it draws from Monterey County vineyards near the Santa Lucia Highlands and Santa Barbara County vineyard between the Santa Maria Valley and the Sta. Rita Hills. The results are solid for the price, with expressive aromas of honeydew and vanilla soda, and a palate of juicy melon and toasted oak. It is slightly boozy, so very much in the cocktail style, and is not for those afraid of oak.",87,13.0,California
65171,Italy,Here's a balanced and bright Chardonnay from a cool climate region in northern Italy that shows crisp aromas of peach and citrus followed by light shadings of spice and bitter almond. The wine is silky and smooth with more citrus on the close.,88,38.0,Northwestern Italy
65172,US,"This is a supple, spicy wine, with a core of black cherry fruit. It's complemented with lighter flavors of cola, earth and coffee. At first it seems to fade a little too quickly, but with some breathing time the finish expands and brings in notes of cracker and toast.",91,39.0,Washington
65173,US,"Vibrant tangerine and red-apple flavors are concentrated and fresh on the nose and palate of this barrel-fermented Chardonnay. On the palate, it's a silky and textured wine that builds lusciously in body. Warming notes of vanilla, spice and just a touch of canned creamed corn linger on the finish.",87,19.0,New York
65174,France,"Black cherry aromas are followed by rich black fruit, plum and damson flavors in this wine. There is plenty of juicy acidity here as well, with tannins to support the richness. Drink from 2020.",91,25.0,Bordeaux
65175,Germany,"Representing a bit of a chink in von Kesselstatt's impressive array of 2009s, this wine features slightly restrained notes of pineapple and green apple in a slightly uneasy alliance of sweet and sour. Drink up.",86,30.0,Mosel
65176,US,"Sweet, smoky oak and ultraripe flavors of tropical fruits mark this Chardonnay. It's strong and obvious in its appeal, but bright acidity and a stony minerality ground it, and the finish is thoroughly dry.",89,40.0,California
65177,Chile,"Wiry plum and green-tobacco aromas transition to red-fruit scents as this breathes. A fresh, forward palate is medium in body, while a mix of spice, green herb, olive, plum and berry notes comprise the flavor package. A tight, juicy palate maintains the wine's core flavors.",86,10.0,Colchagua Valley
65178,France,"This is a firm wine with ripe Merlot fruits that are still sheathed in tannins. Densely textured, it is rich with berries and a stalky character that needs to soften. Wait for this solid, concentrated and ageworthy wine until 2017.",90,65.0,Bordeaux

65183,US,"Bright, sappy, with fresh raspberries, mocha, moist earth and light details of green herb. With alcohol just over 14%, this has young vine flavors, a bit less concentration than the very best Washington Syrahs, but it's balanced and tasty.",90,34.0,Washington
65184,Germany,"Hints of crushed slate lend a smoky, flinty character to concentrated flavors of tangerine and quince preserve in this beautiful off-dry Riesling. It's intensely fruity, but anchored in minerality from start to finish.",90,25.0,Mosel

65189,US,"A spicy, bold, fruit-powered take on Pinot Noir. William Hill is the proprietor. The wine comes across as sort of a California-Oregon hybrid, mixing the slightly herbal, moderately tannic Oregon grapes with a fruit-forward, cranberry core.",88,36.0,Oregon

65191,US,"A lovely example of Pinot Noir from one of the rare places in Washington that can do the flighty grape justice. It is a 50/50 blend of the 2008 and 2009 vintage—a crafty winemaker decision that has worked beautifully. The wine strikes a perfect balance, neither too young and sharp, nor too soft and fruity. Light touches of cedar and smoke wrap around fruit flavors of strawberry and cherry pie. It stops a little short at the moment, but that might just be a function of limited bottle age.",88,30.0,Washington
65192,US,"A rustic, 100% varietal wine from Corbett vineyard, Leo is soft and approachable. It's a wine to please a range of palates in its lushness of blueberry and black licorice.",86,65.0,California
65193,US,"Oaky, spicy and tannic, this is showing some sharp edges around moderately ripe plum and cherry fruit. It's solid and substantial, a bit blocky, and currently showing more barrel influence than fruit. All estate fruit, 40% new French oak. Additional bottle age might improve the score.",88,36.0,Oregon

65196,US,"This contends for the best $10 Riesling in the country. It's off dry, with 30g/L of residual sugar, but not too sweet for some Asian noodle entrées. The mouthfeel is thick and borders on syrupy, with penetrating flavors of mango, papaya and peaches. It could also be served after dinner with fruit and soft cheeses.",91,10.0,Oregon
65197,Germany,"A musky perfume accents fresh lemon and tangerine aromas on this off-dry wine. It's ripe and rich on the palate with flavors of quince and yellow peach. Zesty with lime, it finishes moderately long with a hint of savory herbs.",87,9.0,Rheinhessen

65209,Austria,"A wonderfully light-footed Riesling that has an energetic, lively core fizzing with lemon freshness and verve. There is a very light touch here, but despite all this filigree structure there is depth and a profound sense of pure citrus flavor. This really gets under your skin with its very own, tiptoeing, featherlight way. The pure lemons last and last.",92,25.0,Traisental
65210,US,"The vineyard is a fine one, the fruit source for highly regarded Pinots from Tandem and Bailiwick's own Silver Pines label. The wine is dry and silky, with strong acidity and tannins that currently render it tough to appreciate. Give it 5–6 years to let the raspberry and cola flavors integrate with the oak.",92,44.0,California
65211,New Zealand,"A light- to medium-bodied Sauvignon, the 2009 Discovery is more delicate than many of its counterparts, with hints of stuck flint, accenting stone fruit and citrus flavors. Turns chalky and crisp on the finish. Drink now.",87,15.0,East Coast

65217,France,"Despite coming from a universally hailed vintage, this generic Bordeaux is still weedy, herbal and lean.

It's light, but it hasn't been dumbed down for the mass market.",85,9.0,Bordeaux
65218,US,"Despite this wine's initial big-barrel influence, it becomes a complex, satisfying mix of salted caramel, melon and ginger that remains relatively light bodied and able to display minerality. At an attractive price, it's worth considering for midweek meals and larger gatherings.",90,18.0,California
65219,US,"A big, thick, massive Cabernet, impressive for sheer volume. Yet it's very tannic and dry. Deep down inside is an intense core of concentrated blackberry essence, coated in smoky new oak. This feels dramatic and important, but nowhere near ready. Give it eight years in the cellar.",94,100.0,California
65220,Chile,"Bright but tart cherry and blackberry flavors are swathed in dusty tannins; the nose offers similar berry and plum aromas. It's a little acidic, but finishes with nice dusty-plum flavors.",86,12.0,Casablanca Valley
65221,Chile,"Basic melon and peach aromas become more pungent and citrusy with airing. The palate has weight and zest but lacks complexity, while the flavors are citrusy and green, much like Sauvignon Blanc, which is common for this wine based on past performance.",84,14.0,Colchagua Valley
65222,US,"This blend is principally Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot with a pinch of Petit Verdot blended in. The barrel aromas (24 months in all-new French) stand out at first, with notes of chocolate, coffee and spice. The black-fruit flavors are full bodied and high-octane, showing some warmth on the finish. The oak needs more time to integrate.",90,55.0,Washington
65223,US,"This aromatic wine brings a pleasing assortment of smoke, bacon fat, citrus, plum and blue-fruit notes. It coats the palate from end to end with sultry fruit flavors that lead to a tart, dry finish.",91,38.0,Washington
65224,Chile,"Clean on the nose, with pure citrus and minerality. It's full but not heavy in the mouth, with developed, mature flavors of grapefruit and other citrus fruits. Mildly pithy, green and long on the finish. Not a prima ballerina; this has force and strength along with elegance.",89,18.0,Casablanca Valley
65225,US,"Tall Tales is a new designation for the winery's reserve Syrah. It's unfined, unfiltered and unabashed—a potent, powerful wine which teeters on the edge of bitterness. But within its compact and textural body are lively flavors of boysenberry and coffee grounds, tobacco and vanilla, cola and rock. It pushes deep into the palate and extends into a complex and long-lasting finish.",93,53.0,Washington
65226,US,"Lees and new oak seem to prevail in this wine, giving it a yeasty, caramelized taste that overpowers the fruit, which seems just fine in pineapples, peaches and limes.",84,35.0,California
65227,US,"Beautiful aromas of rose and lavender open this wine, followed by intense mushroom, truffle and earth. Bright in acidity, a wild strawberry flavor sharpens the focus as soft, well-integrated tannins and subtle oak intermingle. The entire package finishes with a bang of crisp red-cherry fruit.",93,45.0,California
65228,Canada,"“Open and drink” the instructions should read, as this smooth and luscious wine is best enjoyed young. Half was barrel-fermented, yielding flavors of caramel, almond paste and buttered nuts. Pair with leek, bacon and potato soup, says the winery, which sounds just about perfect.",89,20.0,British Columbia
65229,Germany,"Subtle notes of crushed mineral and lime on the nose contrast the lush tangerine and orange flavors in this off-dry, concentrated wine. It's harmoniously sweet, balanced neatly by strikes of steel and acid that tighten the finish. Drink now through 2019.",89,13.0,Mosel
65230,US,"The very fine Allen Vineyard, on Westside Road in the tenderloin of the appellation, has produced a high-quality Chardonnay that is capable of some bottle aging. Dry and savory, it shows a strong mineral component to the pie filling limes, lemondrop, apple, fig and roasted hazelnut flavors. Should develop before fading, over the next 5 years.",92,48.0,California
65231,US,"This 100% Cabernet is very rich in blackberries and black currants, with a thick coating of hard tannins. It's bone dry, with crunchy acidity, but not particularly drinkable now. Age until at least 2022 to let it begin to throw some sediment and soften up.",93,72.0,California
65232,Australia,"Offers a mishmash of aromas that include plenty of woody notes like vanilla and toast as well as cherry fruit. The result in the mouth comes across as slightly medicinal, with cherry and menthol flavors that turn tangy on the finish. Imported by Walca International.",84,12.0,South Australia

65234,Argentina,"Saucy, herbal aromas of tomato and red plum are scratchy. This is fresh and juicy, but also high in acidity. Flavors of red plum, red currant and vanilla come with herbal infusions prior to a mildly spicy finish.",85,14.0,Mendoza Province
65235,France,"The ninth generation of the Dublois family goes for tight cropping on only 7.5 acres for Nectar (95% Merlot, 5% Cabernet Sauvignon). Layers of wood dominate this wine. However, it does promise fruit as well, shown by the weight and richness. So it's a wine for a pause, to allow the intense spice and new wood flavors to die down. Firm and dry now, it will be worth the wait. Drink from 2018.",90,35.0,Bordeaux
65236,Austria,"Full-fruited peachiness is tempered by tangy lemon acidity with texture and concentration. It's fruity and refreshing, but also very precise and delicious.",91,21.0,Kremstal
65237,US,"Stoller does an all-stainless style of Chardonnay, and does it well consistently. The winery slogan—Authentically Oregon—fits the ultraclean, crisp and authoritative styling. The fresh apple fruit is pushed along by sappy acidity, showing length, purity and focus.",90,25.0,Oregon
65238,France,"A solid and concentrated wine, with burnt wood, bitter extraction and only a hint of blackberry fruit for the long term.",84,15.0,Bordeaux
65239,US,"The best of a great flight of single-vineyard 2009 Pinots from Adelsheim, this new entry into the lineup is all muscle and black fruits. It is power-packed with dense, rich flavors, nuanced with exotic spices and black tea, moving into silky tannins and an extremely long, satisfying finish.",95,90.0,Oregon
65240,Chile,"This blend of Cabernet Sauvignon, Syrah and Merlot opens with blackened aromas of charred oak and creosote, but it quickly sheds that oak-heavy character to display toasty flavors of olives, herbs and berry fruits. All together, this is a classic Chilean red blend, with fine tannins and patented lightly herbal, balsamic flavors. Drink through 2020.",91,29.0,Aconcagua Valley
65241,US,"A simple but likeable Pinot Noir, this is light-bodied, dry and clean, with brisk, mouthwatering acidity. The flavors suggest cherry and raspberry Life Savers, with a hit of mint tea. Ready to drink now.",86,24.0,California
65242,France,"This wine has great power along with magnificently rich fruit. Wood aging provides a judicious support to its fullness and opulence. Acidity, black cherries and red berry fruits come together with firm tannins. Combined they are already in balance, but the wine needs to wait. Drink from 2018.",96,480.0,Burgundy
65243,France,The producer has the largest nursery of old grape varieties in southwest France and from it has plucked the Manseng Noir to blend with Merlot. The result is a rich wine with ripe Merlot red fruits that are given a more tannic character with the Manseng. There is a fresh juicy aftertaste that allows it to be drunk now.,87,15.0,Southwest France
65244,US,"Dark red cherry, crushed carnations, rose petals and a hint of nutmeg spice show on the nose of this bottling from an increasingly famous vineyard in this region. The palate's rich expression combines black plum, clove, red-cherry and mace flavors, bolstered by a fresh acidity.",93,55.0,California
65245,Chile,"Gritty aromas of black olive and road tar rest heavily atop herbal berry scents. This mystery blend is tight and tannic as nails. Blackened flavors of gritty blackberry, clove and wood spice finish rough and scratchy.",86,14.0,Colchagua Valley
65246,US,"Dark golden-yellow, this opens with inviting notes of toasted caramel. It remains bright in citrus on the palate, getting riper and steamier as it goes, developing deeper, richer flavors of preserved lemon and baked pear. From the winery's estate, this is a small-production wine well worth seeking.",92,39.0,California
65247,US,"Textured vanilla-cream and green apple appear initially in this wine, which offers plenty of weight and structure around a core of balanced acidity and fresh lemon zest. Cardamom and vanilla play at the edges alongside elements of savory brine and white flowers. The oak presence is subtle.",92,58.0,California
65248,Chile,"An opaque purple Pinot? Yes indeed. This wine from southerly Bío Bío looks like Malbec and smells extracted and heavy. The palate is tannic, while intense flavors of grapy berry and black fruits finish peppery, then loamy, then hot.",84,14.0,Bío Bío Valley
65249,Chile,"Gê is one of Chile's perennial best blends. It mixes Syrah, Carmenère and Cabernet Sauvignon into a lovable, complex whole. The nose is spicy yet suave, with cool berry, herb and olive aromas. It feels fresh, full and clean, with olive, pepper, cherry, cassis, coffee and chocolate flavors on the palate and finish. Only 452 cases made; drink now–2017.",92,92.0,Colchagua Valley
65250,US,"Despite the California appellation, the grapes were grown in the Ojai region of Santa Barbara County. It's a dry, tannic wine whose ripe blackberry, mocha and oak flavors are balanced with rich earthiness. Could develop bottle complexity over the next six years.",90,45.0,California
65251,US,"Rich fruit and cream flavors and a smooth, almost sweet impression in the mouth add up to a palate-pleasing taste. This smells like lime, honeydew and cream, feels rounded on the palate, tastes like poached pears and has a soft finish.",85,19.0,California
65252,US,"A pretty pale pink in color, this bottling is very yeasty, reminiscent of a sparkling wine, also showing sour strawberry, wet stone and orange peel on the nose. The yeast is prominent through the sip, dominating the sharp kumquat and pink-fruit flavors.",86,32.0,California
65253,US,"The aromas are generous, with notes of freshly cut wood, custard and herb. The palate is full bodied, rich and creamy in feel. The wood shows prominently and it brings warmth on the finish.",88,48.0,Washington

65258,US,"This beautiful wine includes 9% Cabernet Franc that gives a lift of floral violet and grainy cedar. Classic all around in its etchings of coconut shavings, graphite, spice and dust, the fruit is additionally savory in bright red currant and a crunch of cassis, with an underpinning of soft, succulent blackberry.",94,100.0,California
65259,US,"Gooseberry and lychee candy pervade over subtle notes of lemon, lime and eucalyptus. Vibrant on the palate, lychee and gooseberry remain the stars but take on a bitterness. Racy acidity is prevalent and lends itself to a tart finish.",85,24.0,Virginia
65260,France,"This medium-bodied rosé is a blend of 60% Grenache and 40% Syrah drawn from the estate's young vines. Like its big brother, the Vieilles Vignes, it's gently textured, easily balancing red berry fruit against citrusy elements. It's a clean, refreshing, but somewhat simple quaffer at a bargain price.",87,11.0,Rhône Valley
65261,France,"This full, ripe wine is rich with strawberry and red plum fruit. It's weighty on the palate with flavors of orange zest and a touch of spice. Brisk acidity cuts through the palate adding freshness on the finish.",87,12.0,Provence

65263,US,"This wine is a blend of 40% each Mourvèdre and Syrah along with 15% Petite Sirah and 5% Viognier. Aromas of orange zest, flowers, raw meat and peppery spices lead to a soft palate, full of citrus flavors that seem a bit out of balance but that still provide intrigue.",88,20.0,Idaho
65264,US,"Scented with notes of pine needle and lemon polish, this puts its concentration square in the mid-palate. There are pretty traces of honeyed botrytis, and a suggestion of sweetness, though the acidity keeps it on the dry side. Excellent length, with a pretty finish of honey and tea.",90,15.0,Washington
65265,France,"From one of the parcels that make up the larger Corton Grand Cru, this is a powerful wine with a proper sense of its dignity. It is stylish as well as rich—an elegant blending of ripe red fruits, tannins and acidity. The wine of course has great potential and will not be ready to drink until 2025.",94,,Burgundy
65266,US,"This cuvée offers a mix of blue and purple fruits, with a forward grape-candy-character dominant. It's fruity and drinking nicely, but lacks the stuffing to improve much further with age.",89,35.0,Oregon
65267,US,"Very dry, with mouth-watering acidity, but the palate also searches for a little more fruit than the wine offers. Still, the pineapples, peaches and apricots are pleasant enough.",88,33.0,California
65268,Germany,"Layers of stone, ash, steel and lanolin are showstopping on this intensely minerally Rheingau Riesling. Dry and full-bodied in style, this has delicate stonefruit and yellow-cherry flavors that play an understated role, but linger sweetly on the finish.",90,69.0,Rheingau

65271,France,"Very aromatic, gentle, almost floral notes of Cox's Orange Pippin appear with the first whiff. They get their full due on the off-dry palate which boosts the fruit flavors and paints them in a golden light. There is grip and backbone and ample fruit. Drink while the fruit is at its height: 2016–2018. Finishes off dry.",89,35.0,Alsace
65272,South Africa,"A fresh citrus and delicate tropical fruit nose gives this Durbanville white a stylish start. Steely and crisp on the palate, with flavors of gooseberry and grass, the wine is balanced and soft. Pair with grilled seafood or salads.",87,25.0,Durbanville
65273,France,"This 100% Sauvignon Blanc has a crisp background, with a mineral character that gives it a firm texture that needs to soften. It's perfumed, full in the mouth and will be better from 2016.",86,,Bordeaux
65274,US,"A light-colored, lemon-zesty, cool-vintage Chardonnay that's fruit forward but has great balance and finish, light on the tongue and easygoing all around.

65275,Chile,"Scratchy red plum aromas are sort of sharp and mulchy. This has a standard, healthy feel along with dry, oaky plum flavors. Mild spice and limited fruit character define the short finish.",85,15.0,Cachapoal Valley
65276,US,"Kian Tavakoli is the winemaker for this small-production Cabernet Sauvignon with some Merlot, Petit Verdot and Cabernet Franc. A brambly, full-bodied wine, it's concentrated in black fruit with a spicy streak of clove.",91,54.0,California
65277,Australia,"A very good effort, this may be among the last great values to emerge from Australia, as smaller crops and changing currencies will undoubtedly take their toll. It's remarkable that McLaren Vale fruit can go into a $12 bottle. Black cherry fruit is presented on a medium-bodied, softly tannic frame, embellished by hints of cola and eucalyptus. Finishes soft, with a fine texture of charcoal dust and lingering cassis flavors.",89,12.0,South Australia
65278,Australia,"This Cabernet equivalent to Grange has exploded in price (I remember tasting the 1996 on release when it was $25 per bottle), but there's no questioning the quality. A deep, intense nose of cassis, earth, menthol and cedar is followed by a full, rich palate that's supple without being soft. Brighter notes of red fruit emerge on the lengthy finish, which is dominated by sweet fruit and creamy lactones. Drink 2020–2030, and probably well beyond.",95,500.0,South Australia

65286,France,"A sumptuous wine from a vintage that is fruity and generous. It does show some of the structure of the appellation, but the juicy cherry and ripe strawberry flavors dominate. It's going to develop into a rich and early-maturing wine. Drink from 2017.",91,80.0,Burgundy
65287,US,"With lots of spices and maple syrup notes, this smells and tastes rich, nearly sweet, smooth in texture and medium in body. It should be good with barbecue, because the perceived sweetness can soften spicy, peppery food.",86,13.0,California
65288,Argentina,"An improvement over the dull, mulchy 2005; this wine is still a little earthy, heavy and gaseous out of the bottle but with airing it offers ripe strawberry and plum flavors with licorice and tree-bark accents.

65292,US,"This very dry wine is dominated by its hard tannins, and comes across as a bit rigid and austere, especially by California standards. Yet it's very finely structured, with a keen edge of black pepper to the currant and blackberry flavors buried way beneath. Give it through 2009, but if you must drink now, decant.",90,125.0,California
65293,Italy,"The Val di Cornia Suvereto appellation may not be recognized much abroad (or even in Italy), but it is definitely worth keeping an eye on.

65300,US,"The name comes from a Django tune, and also means “clouds” in French. Nothing cloudy here though—it's a pretty, lively, fruit-driven blend with cherry candy flavors. Crisp and fresh, a streak of cola runs comet-like through the tail, along with a hint of mint.",88,40.0,Oregon
65301,US,"For $15 or less, you can't expect a great Pinot Noir, but you can expect a good everyday one, which is what this is. It's dry, silky and smooth, with cherry pie and white pepper flavors.",85,15.0,California

65309,US,"Driven by 72% Merlot, with 15% Cabernet Sauvignon and 13% Cabernet Franc, this affordable offering is brawny and tightly wound in woody tannin, with a thickness to the texture. Big oak cradles bold flavors of black coffee and tobacco.",88,35.0,California

While the oak influences are strong, they are perfectly in keeping with the underlying volume.",96,125.0,California
65328,US,"Even nearing six years of age, this Merlot remains tannic, although the cherry and blackberry fruit is starting to dry out. There's a curious sweetness at its core. Not going anywhere, so drink up.",85,49.0,California
65329,France,"This vivid pink-colored wine, 50-50 Merlot and Cabernet Sauvignon, is soft, with gentle fruitiness and crisp edge. Acidity and a herbal edge add a more textured character. Drink now.",84,10.0,Bordeaux
65330,US,"Shows the elegantly crisp, almost austere structure of the winery's 2009s, courtesy of the cool vintage. Tight at first in acids and tannins, as it warms it gives off deep layers of sour cherries, cola, pomegranates and rhubarbs, all of them dry, earthy fruits that sing of the soil. Should develop bottle complexity through 2015.",93,58.0,California
65331,US,"This light, elegant wine uses estate-grown fruit, and brings the same general character as the single vineyard offerings. Briary berry fruit, with pepper and spice, shows a more herbal aspect than the single vineyard wines. Sealed in screwcap, this wine may be enjoyed over the next 4–6 years.",88,36.0,Oregon
65332,US,"Three vineyards contribute to this lovely wine, two in Rutherford, both certified organic, and another in Soda Canyon which is at 800-feet in elevation. Red and blue fruit open for leather and a touch of cedar and dried herb—the wine ultimately elegant and Old World. The tannin weight is substantial but never distracting.",91,75.0,California
65333,Italy,"A blend of 90% Sangiovese, 7% Canaiolo and 3% Colorino, this opens with aromas that recall charred earth, blackberry, blue flowers and a whiff of game. The taut palate offers dried black cherry, mint and brown baking spices alongside firm, fine-grained tannins.",89,23.0,Tuscany
65334,US,"Although not indicated on the label, this wine is sourced from a vineyard in the Santa Maria Valley. It's a very good, but predictable, Chardonnay, spotlighting honeyed tropical fruit, lime and peach, along with oak-fueled notes of vanilla and buttered toast.",88,38.0,California
65335,US,"Some aspects of this wine have changed since the 2014 vintage: the alcohol is lower, and the exposure to new French oak (50%) is higher. There's something amiss, however. While light strawberry fruit and hints of chicken stock show on the palate, there's a foreshortening and feeling of dilution on the finish.",86,52.0,Oregon
65336,US,"This full-bodied wine combines deep, ripe fruit flavors, light spicy accents and a very firm mouthfeel that begs for a bite of a grilled rosemary lamb chop. The wine pushes the stereotype of wimpy Merlot out of the way and does it with fruit concentration rather than obvious oak. Drink through 2020.",90,22.0,California
65337,France,"From its origins in the Middle Ages, this estate has always been a vineyard. This latest vintage released is fruity with wood aging still obvious in the toastiness and spice. But there is plenty of rich berry fruit to give this wine a good short-term potential. Drink from late 2018.",87,,Bordeaux
65338,France,This is a yeasty wine that shows a bitter almond character. It has an unattractive hard edge.,82,28.0,Burgundy

65340,Austria,"Fresh earth and gloriously ripe stone fruit make for a convincing opening on the nose. The palate swings with this sonorous, earthy edge and frames rich, ripe and rounded pear and yellow plum fruit. Overall, there is zesty fresh citrus that gathers everything together and presents a concentrated wine with drive and personality. The finish is long, clean and convincing. Drink 2020–2040.",94,45.0,Wachau
65341,US,"Winemaker Bill Brosseau tapped into his family's vineyard to produce this light and delicate wine. Its aromas suggest white flowers, key lime and chalk, while its flavors are high-toned and tight, recalling chilled pear, lime and pomelo pith. A graphite-like minerality adds complexity.",92,49.0,California
65342,US,"A rich, decadent and generous wine, 100% varietal, this is both floral and fruity, bright in cherry and raspberry alongside herbal cedar and vanilla. A medium weight surrounds softly integrated tannins, leading the way to an explosive, juicy finish. This is a classic example of the appellation's prowess in approachable power.",93,85.0,California
65343,US,"This wine has a compelling earthy funkiness that's both varietal and fun, a tangle of red fruit, sassafras and cardamom that's light and bright. It makes a great companion to food.",90,45.0,California
65344,US,"From a warm vineyard site in a cool year, this Cab intrigues in sage and chewy black cherry, possessed of a powerful, buoyant minerality. Dark chocolate, tobacco and black tea frame the generous ripeness and velvety nature of the wine, which can withstand time in the cellar to commingle more, through 2021.",93,175.0,California
65345,US,"This is a big Pinot Noir, with an explosive intensity of cherries and raspberries that is ripe and pure. Oak, of course, is there too, in the form of buttered, smoky toast. However, the wine isn't a mere fruit bomb. It has interesting nuances of earthy things, like mushrooms, nettles and Provençal herbs. The silky texture is an exquisite balance of acids and tannins. This new brand from Hall winery is made by their talented winemaker, Steve Leveque, and it immediately enters the California pantheon of excellent Pinot Noirs.",95,60.0,California
65346,US,"Fresh green herbs and lime zest lend vibrance to this lighter-bodied bottling from Wiemer's 2015 vintage. White grapefruit and citrus are piercing and spry, finishing with a delightful edge of salt and crushed-stone. Drinks beautifully now but should develop well through 2028.",94,39.0,New York

65349,US,"This is a big Pinot Noir, full-bodied and dry, and a little heavy. But it's rich, offering delicious waves of cherries, raspberries, red currants, licorice, cola and savory spices. Unclear if it will age, but nice now with steaks, chops, grilled salmon.",88,38.0,California
65350,US,"Austere and elegant, this wine opens in the glass to deliver fresh-cut apple, matchstick and graham cracker, balancing fruit-forwardness with complexity.

65352,US,"A brisk young Pinot Noir, dry and bright in acidity, with deep, long raspberry, cherry, cola, spice and sandalwood flavors. The tannins are just a bit rustic, so drink this wine now and over the next 2–3 years.",88,42.0,California
65353,US,"Partial whole-cluster fermentation gives this wine an earthy, tannic closedness, making it unsuitable for drinking now. But it's extraordinarily rich in cherry and currant fruit, with such a long sweet finish that it has got to be an ager. Try after 2009.",93,42.0,California
65354,France,"Open and simple, this has a light touch of citrus fruit, with an edge of wood in the background. It is bright and ready to drink.",83,,Burgundy
65355,US,"A thrilling wine, this impresses instantly with its detail and definition. Vividly fruity with a mix of melon, apple and stone fruits, this tangy, toasty effort has nuanced notes of herb and mineral as well. Drink now through 2030.",94,42.0,Oregon
65356,US,"Sweet and oaky, with orange, pineapple and pear jam, buttered toast and vanilla flavors. Plays it safe down the middle by appealing to the popular taste.",86,26.0,California
65357,US,"A fabulous Pinot Noir that's rich and deeply flavored, with the most wonderful structure. After a fruity, spicy entry, the wine sinks down dramatically on the midpalate, offering masses of cherries, raspberries, red currants, cured meats, sautéed mushrooms, spices and sweetly toasted sandalwood. Bone dry, and capable of aging eight years in the cellar, it surpasses even the 2007 West Slope, arguably making it one of the greatest Carneros Pinot Noirs ever made.",97,100.0,California
65358,Israel,"This salmon-colored wine has a bouquet of pear, rose petal and lime zest. It is a little tart at first sip, but is ultimately well balanced and refreshing, with flavors of strawberry, peach and rose that lead to a lime sorbet finish.",87,20.0,Israel
65359,US,"The oak is quite primary on this wine with its aromas of vanilla and coffee in front of mineral and cranberry. The palate has sweet, rich fruit flavors with a tart finish.",88,36.0,Oregon
65360,US,"This serious red blend puts together a texture firmed up with gripping tannins and acidity, flavors brimming with blackberry and sweet spices and a lingering finish. Too structured to appreciate alone, it will need pairing with roast beef, lasagna, ribs or the like.",88,17.0,California

65362,Germany,"Heady aromas of honeysuckle, peach and herb hint to the complexity of this dry-style Riesling.

65365,Germany,"Lean and spry, this invigoratingly dry Riesling highlights a sense of minerality over fruit. Layers of slate and chalk penetrate the palate, allowing momentary glimpses of tart melon and tangerine to peep through. It's a refreshing, zesty wine ideal alongside rich, creamy fare, and enjoyable now through 2017.",88,28.0,Rheingau
65366,Italy,"This savory Merlot and Cabernet Sauvignon blend offers aromas of bell pepper, red currant and plum that carry over to the palate, along with toasted sensations of espresso and oak. Its linear structure will pair well with grilled chicken seasoned with rosemary and grilled vegetables.",87,18.0,Veneto

65368,US,"This is a Bordeaux blend, based on Merlot, with some Petite Sirah mixed in. It's very dry, quite full-bodied and a little rustic, with some tough, edgy tannins. Doesn't seem like an ager, but it will benefit from a few hours in a decanter.",87,36.0,California
65369,US,"This wine is a blend of Syrah (76%), Grenache (21%) and Viognier (3%). Perfumed aromas of orange peel, flowers, spice and dark fruit lead to plump raspberry and smoked meat flavors. It needs time to unwind.",91,35.0,Washington

65371,Argentina,"Stone-fruit and melon aromas are a touch gritty and sulfuric. This light-colored racy Chardonnay is citrusy on the palate, with acidic grip and grab. Tangy citrusy buttercup flavors finish sturdy and steady.",86,12.0,Mendoza Province
65372,France,"This is a rich and rounded wine, and its tannins have already integrated into the soft, ripe black fruits. It has concentration and an attractive juiciness for drinking after 1–2 years.",88,20.0,Bordeaux
65373,US,"This multi-vineyard blend opens with light floral notes, hits the palate with spice, clove and pepper, then brings in cranberry and pie cherry fruit. Complex and racy, it will be best with additional cellaring.",88,24.0,Oregon
65374,US,"Cream, vanilla, baking spice, key lime pie and tropical fruit aromas lead to a rich, flavorful palate, redolent with pineapple and kiwi flavors that hang on the clean crisp finish.",90,20.0,Washington
65375,Chile,"This is definitely a cool-climate SB from Chile. The nose is crisp yet not pushy, with aromas of gooseberry, nettle and snap pea along with grapefruit and lemon. A punchy, lively palate feel is just right for the wine's passion fruit, nettle, tangerine and grassy flavors, while the finish is long and cutting.",90,16.0,Casablanca Valley
65376,France,"One year of wood aging has given this wine its toasty character. It is balanced with the red-cherry fruit and acidity. Named after the constable who controlled the castle of Sancerre in the Middle Ages, the wine is dense with tannins as well as the fruit. It should be ready to drink, although it does seem on the dry side.",89,30.0,Loire Valley
65377,Australia,"Despite a nose and palate that delivers plenty of mixed citrus fruit, this comes across as very dry. It's lemony and crisp on the long, austere finish. Drink now with oysters, or cellar for 5–10 years.",92,20.0,South Australia
65378,France,"This rich wine is ripe with red-berry fruits, mango and peach. Full in the mouth, it has a touch of spice from the Mourvèdre in the blend. Crisp and lively, the wine could age until 2018, although it will be best from late 2016.",90,21.0,Provence
65379,France,"A big, fat, spicy wine flavored with white fruits and laced with crisp acidity. It is full and opulent, but not extravagantly so, the acidity cutting through richness, leaving yellow fruits and some toast.",89,,Burgundy

65381,US,"Pungent citrus notes of kumquat, tangerine, Meyer-lemon pith and grapefruit give depth to accents of apple blossom and toasty seared lemon.

65384,Chile,"Smooth and richly aromatic, with pear and apple notes to go with the full allotment of oak and butter. This is Bisquertt's attempt at a top-shelf Chard, and it isn't a bad effort. The palate deals plenty of pear and mango flavors, while the finish is warm and oaky. Well made, yet a bit flat. Drink this year for best results. Best Buy.",87,12.0,Colchagua Valley
65385,US,"A strong, bold young wine, with good varietal flavors of blackberries and black currants. It's hard in tannins now, and the oak hasn't been integrated even though the wine is nearing the five year mark. Somehow, it doesn't seem like a longterm ager, but it will benefit from a couple years in the bottle.",87,50.0,California
65386,US,"This wine has a glorious floral nose highlighted in honey and wildflowers, revealing richer gingerbread and toasted oak undertones as it opens. Its creamy texture provides a sense of unctuousness, complemented by tart green apple and lemon on the finish.",91,55.0,California
65387,US,"A wine of this size and weight has nowhere to go on the palate, remaining massive, sour and puckering. A 100% Cabernet Sauvignon given plenty of time in oak, it's cranked too high.",81,75.0,California
65388,Australia,"Penfolds Bin 707 has leapt in quality over the past few vintages. The 2009 features hints of mint, cedar and vanilla accenting ripe cassis fruit. It's full bodied and rich, velvety without being overly soft, with a dusty tannic structure that should support it over two decades or more of aging. Drink 2015–2030+.",95,200.0,South Australia
65389,Chile,"Sweet and smoky on the nose, with prune, hickory and spice aromas that come together well. The palate on this four-grape blend is saturated and meaty, while the flavors of blackberry, coffee and dark plum are lush and finish with toast and spice.

65390,France,"Rich, elegant and classic, this wine is made from fruit sourced from old vines—some as much as 70 years old. It has a tannic structure, but the dominant elements are the dense red- and black-plum flavors, which are supported by the wine's acids. Age it for 5–6 years.",91,,Burgundy

65393,US,"Among all eight of the winery's current Rieslings, this was the least accessible upon opening. With ample breathing time it began to show more aromatics, with flavors of orange and pear in a nicely concentrated, well-balanced package. This is the one to decant!",93,28.0,Oregon
65394,US,"A darker shade of blood orange in the glass, this bottling of Cabernet Sauvignon shows cranberry and orange on the nose. It's quite flat on the sip, with sour orange, strawberry and plum notes, and that makes it seem more like an afterthought than a focused rosé, which is such a competitive category now.",84,25.0,California
65395,Germany,"Dark, almost russet in color, this is an eiswein that's definitely out of the ordinary, with notes of fusty library, walnut, dried apricots and figs that come across as a bit syrupy in texture. It seems a bit advanced compared to other eisweins, but it will likely remain at this plateau for decades.",93,316.0,Mosel
65396,US,"Very rich, creamy and oaky, made in the ripe, California style of Chardonnay. Brims with buttered toast, vanilla cream, and caramelized wood aromas and flavors riding over underlying pineapples, pears and limes. Flamboyant, if a little top-heavy. Ready now.",88,38.0,California

65399,US,"Sparkling wine specialist Scharffenberger turns its hand to Chardonnay with interesting results. Acidity is the most notable feature, higher or at least more pronounced than in most California Chards. There's also a mineral undergirding to the lemon preserves and orange zest flavors. This is one of those Chards that will likely take to aging.",87,17.0,California
65400,US,"Ed Sbragia is making some of the most interesting single-vineyard Cabernets in California. This one, from Howell Mountain, shows the density and power that typify all his wines.

Feels like it has the capacity to age for decades.",95,75.0,California
65401,US,"Don't let the generic California appellation fool you, this is a distinctive Chardonnay. It has subtle flavors of pear and toasted oak, and shows a sophisticated and restrained style, with a vibrant fruit core and good balance.

The finished wine is aged in barrel for 40 months prior to bottling, yet it is surprisingly soft in the mouth and equal parts smooth and bright. Aromas of raspberry, black plum and maple give way to flavors of strawberry, cranberry sauce, maple-cured meat and rose petal.",90,120.0,Israel

65412,Austria,"For now, very restrained oak dominates the nose. Wafts of soft smokiness create the impression of a cloud within which red fruit slumbers. This is youthful and comes with a smoky backbone of a structure—a beautiful faultline of fresh acidity. To appropriate a well-used metaphor, this is like a firm handshake from a hand gloved in vermilion velvet. With some time, tender notes of morello cherry tantalizingly appear. This should come with an addiction warning for lovers of elegant Pinots. Drink 2017–2025.",94,50.0,Carnuntum
65413,US,"A ripe Pinot Noir that's marked by toasty oak and big blackberry and black cherry fruit, this wine hails from the mighty Weir Vineyard. It may simply need more time in the cellar to find its balance. Cellar until 2017–2019.",87,65.0,California

65418,US,"Lush and delicious, this is rich with complex berry, currant, cola, spice and cedar flavors. It's earthier and more rustic than the modern style of extreme softness and sweetness, but that's exactly what gives it such charm.",92,64.0,California
65419,US,"This cuvée is principally from the estate (Appassionata) vineyard. Lush, spicy and spread broadly across the palate, it pleases with strawberry-raspberry fruit, milk chocolate and a dusting of cocoa powder.

65481,US,"This opens with a strong scent of herb and bud; it's sharp and aggressively leafy. The wine follows with similar flavors. The light fruit flavors of plum and berry are quickly suffocated with leaf, herb, earth, spice and tannin. Time may be the answer.",85,30.0,Oregon

65541,US,"There's a mellow, honeyed richness to this Chardonnay, with apricot, orange, mango and vanilla flavors making it especially tasty. It's a flamboyant, complex wine at a great price, and easy to find, with 84,000 cases produced.",90,15.0,California
65542,Chile,"Toasty, charred aromas point at pencil lead and graphite in addition to inky black fruits. This old-vines Cabernet is voluminous but tight on the palate, with sandpaper tannins.

65543,Chile,"This fruity, friendly Pinot opens with ripe berry aromas mixed with touches of minerality and latex. It feels fresh and sturdy, with black cherry and raspberry flavors. A pure, sweet, lightly chocolaty finish wraps things up.",89,20.0,Casablanca Valley
65544,US,"From a cool and fog-steeped pocket of the appellation, this wine is defined by its vibrant acidity and grippy structure.

65549,US,"The coolness of the region and vintage shows in this Chard's acidic crispness and minerality.

The finish is as smooth and soft as the entry, with a gentle dusting of cocoa powder.",90,40.0,Oregon
65554,France,"A bruiser of a wine: dark tannins, brawny structure, tough and hard around the edges. That said, its tannins are true to its Nuits-St.- Georges origins in its dry core surrounded by dense fruit.",91,,Burgundy
65555,Italy,"The wine opens with awkward tones that recall Band-Aid and farmyard—these completely blow off after a few minutes in the glass. Beyond them are ripe aromas of black berry fruit, cassis and molasses. It tastes a bit sour but comes through with solid red fruit in the end.",84,15.0,Southern Italy
65556,US,"A vital, focused Cabernet, this shows the sheer classiness of Oakville in its concentrated blackberry and black currant fruit. It's seemingly sweet and dry at the same time, and the tannins, which are extraordinarily thick, are fine and pure. Irresistably delicious now, this changes in the glass by the second. It suggests it wants some time in the cellar, so drink now–2021.",96,85.0,California
65557,US,"Toast, lime and nut butter aromas lead to full-bodied but well-balanced kiwi and pineapple flavors that carry on the finish. The concentration wavers at times but there's plenty to hold interest.",88,18.0,Idaho

65559,US,"This fascinating Chardonnay combines elegance with the opulence you expect from California.

65567,France,"The 100% new oak used in the aging of this wine was not a good idea. It has given too much woodiness and not enough fruit. Still young, it may soften enough to allow the generous blackberry flavors to come through.",87,49.0,Bordeaux
65568,US,"Here's one for the cellar, no doubt about it. Shows classic, old-fashioned Howell tannins, the kind that grip early and lock the palate down throughout. But you can't help but be struck by the immensity of fruit. Massive in sweet blackberries and black currants, liberally oaked, and with a core of minerals, it will develop over the next ten years, at the very least.",94,75.0,California

65580,US,"A massive wine, rich and forward in black cherry and raspberry jam, red currant, bacon and sandalwood flavors.

65582,US,"This wine is crisp, floral and pretty in every way. It's classically structured and graceful, with tart apple notes and stony acidity. It allows the fruit to speak softly and subtly, its lower ripeness detracting from niether flavor nor complexity.",94,72.0,California
65583,Chile,"Toasty, inviting aromas of apple and melon lead to a balanced palate with layered flavors of resiny oak, pear and peach.

65585,US,"An interesting, off-beat Merlot that successfully marches to a different drummer. There's a leathery, meaty quality to the blackberry and cherry fruit flavors that probably comes from the Syrah in the blend. It's also bone dry and fairly rigid in tannins. From an organic-certified vineyard.",92,40.0,California
65586,Italy,"Made with 80% Sangiovese and 20% Syrah, this has aromas of red berry and green tea leaf. The scents carry over to the fresh palate, along with black currant, cinnamon and white pepper. Supple tannins support the juicy flavors.",88,22.0,Tuscany

65592,US,"This old-vine (planted 1972) Pinot offers delicate, yet complex details throughout the palate. It's elegant winemaking at its best—a pinpoint mix of herb, stone, berry and barrel—seamless and precise.

65593,US,"A charming young Cabernet, this is rich in blackberry, currant and anise flavors that are complex and interesting. It's a very dry wine, but the fruit is so polished, it seems almost sweet.

65595,US,"It's unusual to find a nonvintage Pinot Noir, but this wine is unusually good and complex, too.

65596,France,"While Marsannay is mainly planted with Pinot Noir, there are small vineyards of Chardonnay, like this six-acre parcel. It has produced a fruity, ripe wine with a touch of minerality, along with wood and crisp acidity. Light, fruity and ready to drink soon.",89,,Burgundy
65597,US,"A light and tart nose of boysenberry fruit, anise, wild mint and chaparral scrub starts this wine.

65604,US,"This Bordeaux-style blend of 40% Merlot, 30% Cabernet Franc and 30% Cabernet Sauvignon offers a trio of plum, leather and char aromas.

65767,US,"Feels tight and dry and tannic now, and although the pedigree is clear, it's not showing generosity of spirit.

65864,France,"This is an up-front fruity wine with tangy acidity and a crisp texture. It is still young, still almost raw in its character and needs a few months to calm down. But it will be an attractive zesty wine full of fruit. Drink from 2018.",86,11.0,Loire Valley
65865,US,"The winery's more accessible offering, this hearty full-bodied red is impressive in its smoky char and herbal kick—elements that ride along a thickness of tannin and black-fruit concentration.",90,48.0,California
65866,US,"This bottling has been a real success for Zaca Mesa. It's a vibrantly fruity Syrah, packed with sweet cherries and blackberries, with a meaty, umami spiciness suggesting grilled bacon. Deliciously soft, it's best consumed over the next few years.",92,44.0,California
65867,US,"Shy in the glass, this wine needs more time in bottle to unravel its complexities of rose petal and cardamom, flanked by crisp red cherry and raspberry. Tangy acidity is the star and backbone of the lovely, structured wine, which is delightful now, but worth cellaring through 2023.",94,60.0,California
65868,Italy,"Damo has earthy fragrances of tobacco leaf, underbrush and truffle, along with notes of raspberry and spice.

65869,US,"Crisp, pristine blackberry notes are deeply penetrating on the nose and palate. It's ripe and luscious on the palate with layers of savory herb, smoke and hay that add complexity and flair.

65872,US,"A terrific wine, with a crisp, clean, classic nose of pure, crystalline Sauvignon Blanc.

65876,US,"Sourced from the estate's Bayliss-Bower vineyard, this reserve is a barrel selection that saw a touch more new oak (17%) than the regular bottling. It's tannic and a bit chewy, with lush black cherry fruit. Subtle cola and graphite suggestions add complexity.",91,55.0,Oregon
65877,Chile,"Minty, creamy and as oaky as can be. Coconut, sawdust, carob and other barrel-based aromas steal the nose, with secondary black fruit and thick tannins composing the palate. This is a ripped, high-alcohol, almost soupy Syrah that in some people's eye may seem overdone and too woody. But the fruit is of unquestionable high quality, and if you give it time to air out you'll get the best results.",90,82.0,Apalta

The smooth finish is enhanced by a last-second dose of intense acidity.",90,20.0,Upper Galilee

65883,Argentina,"A lot of oak. The nose is honeyed and heavy, with too much toast and butter. In the mouth, it's got kicking acids but the flavors are sweet, oaky and veer toward banana. Resiny on the finish; underwhelming for the price.",84,21.0,Mendoza Province
65884,France,"From a vintage known for its readily-approachable wines, this grand cru Saint-Emilion shows surprising structure. Some toasty oak frames delicate black-cherry fruit.

65888,US,"This big, powerfully fruity Pinot Noir screams coastal California all the way through. The raspberry, cherry and spice flavors, brightened with acidity, taste of long, warm days and cool nights. It's a good wine, but too young, and would have benefited had the winery held it back a year or so before release. Better into 2012.",90,40.0,California

65895,US,"This blush wine is a blend of Cabernet Franc and Merlot. As you'd expect, it's a big wine for a rosé, a little heavy, but there's a nice cut of acidity that helps. Is it dry?

65896,US,"This is Sojourn's most successful 2010 Pinot Noir, because it's the ripest and most satisfying. It shows rich, tantalizing raspberry, cherry and cola flavors that are brightened by brisk acidity. It earns extra points for its complexity.",90,48.0,California

65902,US,"Roughly half of the blend is made from fruit that comes from 30-year-old vines.

It has excellent concentration and impeccable balance, plus a long, satisfying finish.",92,27.0,Washington
65903,Austria,"Smoky cinnamon dominates the nose, on the palate where notes of red currant and cranberry become apparent. The palate is tightly gathered in its finely constructed, tannic frame.

Ready from 2016.",90,63.0,Niederösterreich
65904,Italy,"From the Castel del Monte wine zone in northern Puglia, Bolonero is a blend of 70% Nero di Troia and 30% Aglianico aged in stainless steel. The first grape renders bright fruit tones of cherry and blackberry, and the second delivers power and structure.",87,,Southern Italy
65905,US,"Comprised of traditional Port varieties, this is a very dry, high-acid wine of a certain charm. With its silky texture and cherry and rose petal flavors, you might mistake it for a countrified Grenache. It finishes in a swirl of cloves, cinnamon and other dusty spices.",86,22.0,California

65919,US,"Full-flavored and textured, probably from the use of a Sauvignon Musque Clone for half of the wine, this is nonetheless a light wine, subtle in stone fruit, kiwi and lemon-lime.

65932,Italy,"A heavy dose of oak takes center stage in this blend of 85% Montepulciano and 15% Cabernet and Syrah.

Doesn't have the balance for aging, so drink now with upscale beef and lamb dishes.",88,75.0,California

65956,Argentina,"Potent but integrated oak and blackberry aromas come with a note of licorice. This blend of Malbec, Cabernet Sauvignon and Cab Franc is blocky and almost collapses under its own weight. Herbal, spicy flavors of fresh mushroom, roasted plum and tomato are typical of Salta.

65957,France,"Situated at the highest point of the Entre-deux-Mers region, the estate is dominated by the ripe Merlot in this wine. It is fruity and soft with lively acidity and gentle tannins.

65962,US,"More Sangiovese (62%) is in the blend this year, with Cabernet and Syrah filling out the rest. It's dark and smoky, featuring an intriguing flavor mix of spun sugar and black cherry.

The wine boasts a lifting nose of cream, hazelnut and baked apples, then dances across the palate with lemon-zest and flint flavors.",91,30.0,California
65969,US,"Interesting components of rural earth, mushroom, plum, dark cherry and cola spice play off each other in this robust, full-bodied Pinot, from the growers of Toboni Vineyards.",87,45.0,California
65970,US,"This wine is colored like a pale Pinot Noir and also shows some bricking. It brings blunt aromas of cherry and spice that lead to dry,seemingly watered-down fruit flavors. It falls flat.",84,18.0,Washington
65971,Germany,"Squeaky-fresh lemon and lime shine a spotlight against sweet melon and stone fruit flavors in this gossamer-textured spätlese. It's dancingly delicate, yet deeply penetrating on the palate, finishing on lingering notes of hazelnut and white flowers.",93,37.0,Rheingau
65972,US,"Spicy new-oak flavors dominate the modest fruit notes in this over-worked wine, knocking it off balance.",84,15.0,California
65973,US,"Enormously rich, showing cola, black cherry pie filling and even some dark chocolate notes. There's a soft sweetness of fruit and oak that suggests drinking this lovely wine now. You can't go wrong with a grilled steak, or carne asada.",92,60.0,California
65974,US,"This is 100% Syrah, grown in the highly regarded Stolpman Vineyard. The wine itself is lush with complex raspberry, cherry, mocha and sweet oak flavors. The acidity is strikingly brisk. Drink up.",88,28.0,California
65975,France,"A beautifully structured wine, with its tannins layered between the ripest black plums, damsons and black currants. It is opulent while remaining dense, concentrated and very serious. Certainly a wine for long-term aging.",98,360.0,Bordeaux
65976,US,"Brooding aromas of barrel spice, dried herbs, cranberry and black cherry lead to ripe but in focus pit-fruit flavors that show a pleasing sense of harmony. A squeeze of firm tannins provides the frame.",90,55.0,Washington
65977,US,"A note of sweet, dark earth picks up tones of worn saddle leather and wood-inflected cherry. Medium in body, this possesses a succulent core and chewy tannins.",87,22.0,Virginia
65978,US,"What a great follow-up to the 2009 vintage. You can put this in the cellar with entire confidence that it will age for likely 10–20 years, and actually improve. At nearly three years of age, it's rich and vibrant with black currants, blueberries and dark chocolate, and a big hit of sweet oak. But the tannins are impossible, locking the mouth down with astringency. It's a pity that most of the 2l,064 bottles produced will probably be opened too young.",94,140.0,California
65979,France,"Packed with attractive red-berries and citrus, this is a warm and ripe wine. It is totally dominated by its fruitiness and by the Syrah that brings a perfumed character to this fine apéritif wine. Drink now.",88,20.0,Provence
65980,US,"Scents of stewed blueberry and black cherry devolve into prunes and raisins on the nose of this bottling, but the dried ginger and dark spice elements add complexity. It's dense on the palate, with strong acidity cutting the meaty quality of the midpalate, with pruney flavors throughout.",85,80.0,California
65981,France,"Firm in tannins, but bright with cherry fruits, this has lovely youthful acidity. Firmer tannins promise good aging over the next 4–5 years.",90,,Burgundy
65982,US,Disagreeable for its harsh acidity and vegetal streak that mars the cherries and suggests a bitter green herb. Disappointing.,82,24.0,California
65983,US,"Concentrated yet balanced, this age-worthy wine is juicy in blackberry and currant, with a chewiness to the palate that gives it strength and power. Tar, tobacco and pencil lead shift around on the palate, before the wine finishes clean and sinewy. Cellar through 2020.",91,89.0,California
65984,US,"Despite ruddy, ripe raspberry and strawberry flavors, there's a leanness to this tart, savory dry rosé. Savory layers of bramble and herb are prominent on the midpalate.",83,14.0,New York
65985,US,"Cabernet Sauvignon makes up just over half of this wine (52%); Merlot (46%) and a pinch of Malbec make up the rest.

65986,US,"This wine is a blend of 65% Cabernet Sauvignon, 10% Merlot, 10% Cabernet Franc, 10% Petit Verdot and 5% Malbec. Aromas of baking spice, red and black fruit and sweet spices are followed by dark-fruit flavors. The tannins come off as a bit dry and burly at present.",88,50.0,Washington
65987,US,"Blackberry and blueberry jam and sweet oak flavors mark this young Syrah. It's dry, tannic and juicy, but a little soft in acidity. Drink it now and over the next few years.",87,45.0,California
65988,US,"Huge, flashy and dramatic, this shows brilliantly ripened fruit and an exquisite texture. Flavor wise, it tastes like pure pie filling seasoned with baking spices. But there's nothing sweet in the finish. Instead, the wine is thoroughly and properly dry, as Merlot should be. Drink now.",91,35.0,California
65989,US,"Aromatic and refreshing, with scents of white blossoms, stonefruits and a hint of beeswax, this is fermented entirely in stainless steel and meant to be enjoyed fresh and young. Squeaky clean on the palate with hints of white peach, underripe pineapple, lime pith and a bright, lemony acidity that tickles the palate.",89,17.0,New York
65990,US,"Cabernet Sauvignon (42%) takes the lead with the rest equal parts Merlot and Cabernet Franc. Aromas of dried herbs, flowers, graphite and dark fruit lead to supple, layered dark fruit flavors back by the grip of dry tannins. Drink now.",91,50.0,Washington
65991,South Africa,"This is a layered, earthy selection, with upfront aromas of leather and cigar box complemented by fruity tones of blackberry and cassis. The medium-weight palate is lush and velvety, and the tannins are fine yet firmly structured. Boysenberry preserves and black pepper linger on the finish.",92,27.0,Stellenbosch
65992,US,"This bottling is usually among the more opulent, successful white dessert wines in California, and the '07 certainly fits that bill. With 20.1% residual sugar, it's fantastically sweet, yet has enough fruity stuffing, balanced by high acidity, to satisfy. The pineapple, apricot and orange flavors could be somewhat more intense but it's certainly a very delicious dessert wine.",93,29.0,California
65993,Bulgaria,This garnet colored wine has aromas of red plums and black pepper. There are jammy flavors of ripe cherry and red raspberry on the palate. There's a nice acidic bite and a pleasant touch of astringency on the finish.,86,9.0,Thracian Valley

65995,US,"A kitchen-sink blend of varieties with Merlot (44%) and Cabernet Sauvignon (26%) taking the lead, this wine offers appealing aromas that suggest high-toned, sweet barrel spices, plum and herbs. It's loaded with cranberry, cherry and plum flavors with a rich mouthfeel that keeps the interest high.",91,18.0,Washington
65996,Argentina,"Dark aromas of black cherry and plum are spicy and suggestive of crude oil. In the mouth, this everyday Cab shows juicy balance and clean lines. Standard black-fruit flavors come with spice notes and a harmonious, long finish.",88,10.0,Mendoza Province
65997,US,"A limited, popular entry in Winderlea's extensive single-vineyard lineup, this suggests cherry kirsch with streaks of coffee and tobacco. The pretty fruit leads into darker notes of tar and espresso. Still young and primary, the Juliard may be among the vintage's most long-lasting wines.",91,48.0,Oregon
65998,US,"Here's a simple, softly tannic Pinot Noir to drink now for its fruitiness. Raspberry, cola and oak flavors are wrapped into a silky palate that finishes dry and spicy.",84,18.0,California
65999,Chile,"There isn't enough fruit on this high flier to give it the unqualified seal of approval. In fact, for $50 it has its issues, namely a nose of boot polish and grainy oak. Seems like the fruit is fading and what's left besides some light raspberry is unabsorbed oak and thin, grabby tannins. Not a bad wine per se but not a big success either.",85,50.0,Central Valley
66000,US,"Baking spice, vanilla, herb, anise and dark cherry aromas are followed by plump cherry and cocoa flavors. The acidity gives the flavors some snap.",90,32.0,Washington
66001,US,"This is a great showing of how Chardonnay can work in Temecula. Fresh Meyer-lemon blossoms meet with lemon curd, clarified butter and vanilla paste on a tangy yet rich nose.

66003,US,"This wine is Cabernet Franc and Merlot with just a smidgeon (4%) of Cabernet Sauvignon blended in.

66006,France,"With Merlot softening the power of Brau-col, this is a full-bodied while rounded wine. Juicy acidity gives a fresh character, and red berry fruits dominate the firm tannins. Balanced and concentrated, it will repay some good aging. Drink from 2017.",88,20.0,Southwest France
66007,France,"This rich, creamy, juicy wine is full of strawberry fruits and ripe tannins. It has weight and density as well as powerful structure. A fresh black-cherry character comes through, giving acidity and a perfumed aftertaste. Drink from 2017.",90,45.0,Burgundy

66009,France,"The Suremain family winery in the main street of Mercurey has cellars going back to the 17th century.

66010,France,"Spicy, rich and concentrated, the important element of acidity working with the ripeness of the juicy black fruits. The wine has density, pushing tannins through to the ripe fruits. It shows a dry element that will take time to integrate.",93,,Burgundy
66011,France,"The aroma of this wine shows strong signs of the wood aging, although red fruits do show as well. There is a minty character from the new wood, berry fruit flavors and the juicy acidity of the vintage. The wine is going to age well over the medium term, so drink from 2015.",88,18.0,Bordeaux
66012,US,"Swanson has a great track record with this wine, which is always in need of time on release. The 2005 shows classic Napa structure, with hard but near-perfect tannins and lush, oak-sweetened black currant, cherry and dark chocolate flavors. Brilliant, but will benefit from a good three or four years in the cellar. Should evolve well beyond 2012.",92,75.0,California
66013,South Africa,"The red plum and cassis aromas are meaty and oak-laden and carry to the smoky palate. This simple wine shows firm tannins and good acids, finishing with a toasty herbal note.",84,25.0,Devon Valley

66017,Italy,"A blend of 60% Gaglioppo and 40% Cabernet Sauvignon, this polished red conveys aromas of underbrush, cassis, grilled herb and red currant. The juicy palate delivers crushed black cherry, ground pepper, licorice, clove and a coffee note alongside velvety tannins.",89,30.0,Southern Italy
66018,Italy,"This 70-30 blend of Montepulciano and Nero di Troia offers vibrant aromas of plum cake, molasses, blueberry and blackberry jam. The wine is rich and ripe in flavors with dark fruit nuances and smooth tannins.",86,11.0,Southern Italy

66021,US,"An impressive Syrah, not just for its ripeness, but for the structure. Fine, firm tannins and acids, along with well-integrated oak, provide a classic framework to the ripe blackberries, leather and chocolate. Good now, with decanting, but really wants 2–4 years of aging.",91,35.0,California
66022,Argentina,"Narrow berry aromas are angular and punchy. This feels high in acidity, with hard tannins. That sharp acidity makes for tart unyielding black plum flavors.",85,30.0,Mendoza Province
66023,US,"Aged four years in oak, this stately wine is adorned with layers of maple sugar, toast and smoked nuts, but its racy sour-cherry flavors shine through brightly. The backbone of this wine is taut with acidity, but bold, richly textured mouthfeel puts the palate at ease. It's sumptuous and revitalizing.",90,35.0,New York

66025,France,"This smooth, ripe wine has just enough wood to give structure without smothering the black berry fruit. With vines close to Listrac, Bibian is at the heart of the Haut-Médoc appellation, producing a rich, structured wine with the juicy fruit typical of the vintage.",90,,Bordeaux
66026,US,"A lovely restaurant-style Pinot Noir, showing lots of class and elegance, yet with enough modesty to step aside and let the food star. Dry and silky, it shows raspberry, cherry, red currant and cola flavors, accented with sweet, smoky oak. Suggested pairings include steak, lamb chops and grilled ahi tuna.",91,40.0,California

66030,Chile,"Chocolaty oak aromas rest heavily atop notes of scrub brush, briar patch and red fruits. This Pinot feels juicy but scouring and grating. Flavors of buttery oak, plum and raspberry are both woody and tart, while this is punchy on the finish. Give this another year or two and it may knit together better than now.",89,36.0,Casablanca Valley
66031,Spain,"Rubbery, generic berry and red-fruit aromas are decent, nothing more. This Garnacha-Tempranillo blend feels fresh, lean and wiry, with raw flavors of plum and red-berry fruits. A high-toned racy finish is the opposite of plush.",86,20.0,Northern Spain
66032,Italy,"Made entirely with Merlot, this opens with delicate aromas of black-skinned fruit and a whiff of baking spice. The mature palate reveals prune and vanilla alongside rather evolved tannins. Enjoy soon.",87,30.0,Tuscany
66033,US,"This wine is from Talley, and while it's nowhere near as good as the parent company's Pinot Noir, it's not bad for the price. Shows a nice, silky texture with bright, juicy flavors of cherries, cranberries and toast.",86,20.0,California
66034,US,"What a bargain in a fine Chardonnay. There is a hint of vanilla, flavors of pears, apples and melons and a rich mouthfeel, perfectly balanced by ample acidity. Should be easy to find, with 15,000 cases produced. From Delicato.",88,17.0,California

66037,US,"Smoky and peppery notes hit the nose first, suggestive of the 21% Syrah in the blend. Notes of oregano and roasted tomato quickly surface. This is a medium-full wine, with a flavor of plum that imbues the lithe core. The defined tannins give it traction.",87,32.0,Arizona
66038,France,"Obviously a wine for Baby Boomers, this is bright and fresh, packed with red fruits and a perfect light pink color. The final taste is lively, clean and crisp.",88,,Provence
66039,Chile,"With a vegetal note, some cocoa and berry on the nose and its simple, rather flat flavor profile, this Cabernet suffers from both vintage deficiencies and over-oaking. Dry and woody on the back end.",82,12.0,Maipo Valley
66040,US,"This has a candied cherry color, vivid strawberry and cotton candy aromas, and on first sip a freshness that's almost startling. On second sip it's more like a light red wine, delicate, medium-bodied, very fruity but easy on the palate.",87,17.0,California
66041,US,"As a 100% varietal wine, blue fruit, vanilla and herb aromas are followed by abundant cherry flavors, with lightly dry tannins backing them up. The oak plays a prominent role.",87,43.0,Washington
66042,US,"Coming from an extreme coastal vineyard three miles north of Cambria, this cool-climate study offers aromas of blistered cherry tomatoes, Eastern European goulash spices and crushed peppercorns of all colors. It's fresh and lively on the palate, with hints of rose and tart raspberry. At the same time, it's quite vegetal, with green notes that will evolve into more balanced umami flavors from 2017 to 2022.",92,48.0,California
66043,US,"The addition of 10% Cabernet Sauvignon and 4% Cabernet Franc add an apparent spiciness and structure to this young, tightly wound wine that's otherwise showy with oak and savory clove notes. Firm tannins and a strong streak of dried herb and cedar add to the mix.",88,38.0,California
66044,US,"Sweet pea blossoms and fresh apples make this dry, medium-bodied Chardonnay quite floral on the nose, but the palate is decidedly savory with a pleasantly creamy palate marked by brisk apple flavors, bright acidity and a smoked nut finish.",85,14.0,New York
66045,US,"This is Capture's unoaked Sauvignon Blanc, although it was aged on the lees, lending the wine a rich creaminess to the very ripe lemon, lime and tropical fruit flavors, which taste a bit sweet on the finish.",86,30.0,California
66046,France,"Fresh ripe black currant fruits are the delicious hallmark of this wine. It is full, rich, juicy, its core of tannins and oak a foil to the freshness and mouthfilling character of the fruit.",87,20.0,Bordeaux

66048,US,"Lemon meringue and graham cracker show first in this rewarding wine that's made in a lush, full-bodied, barrel-fermented style. Golden apple stands out amid the toasted oak, while crisp acidity shines on the finish.",90,45.0,California
66049,US,"This is 100% varietal. It has muscle and mass, with tart purple and black fruits wrapped into layers of earth and slightly metallic tannins. There is a green streak but it adds complexity and is not off-putting. This would be an excellent wine with a simple hanger steak.",87,15.0,Washington
66050,France,"Mushroom aromas indicate a wine that is now mature. It's light, textured with hints of green herbs as well as tannins that are now dry. Not for aging, drink now.",86,60.0,Bordeaux
66051,New Zealand,"This looks to be among the best vintages for this wine, or at least it's one of the most flattering to taste young. Stunning floral notes emerge from the glass, wrapped in ripe black-cherry scents. On the palate, it's slightly plummier, but still retains those exciting rose-petal nuances and folds in hints of spice and earth. Despite the evident suppleness, there's a sense of weight and structure that suggests ageability as well. Drink 2015–2022.",93,69.0,Martinborough
66052,Italy,"Mature plum, scorched earth, grilled sage and a whiff of oak-driven spice aromas lead the nose. The soft, easygoing palate offers juicy black cherry, vanilla, clove and a hint of game alongside rounded tannins.",88,26.0,Tuscany

66056,Italy,"The clean, polished bouquet gives this Cabernet Sauvignon an austere and masculine personality. Beyond the bold aromas of black fruit, leather and tobacco are delicate notes of pressed violet and rum cake. The tannins are solid and firm, and a dusting of mineral gives the palate extra dimension.",91,45.0,Tuscany
66057,US,"Rosella's is a very good vineyard, but this Pinot is unripe and unbalanced. There's an herbal, vegetal note that gets in the way of the cherries and pomegranates. Hard to see it going anywhere, so drink up.",85,45.0,California
66058,US,"Almost all varietal with just a dash of Cabernet Sauvignon (5%) to fill it out, this is an intriguing wine with notes of cherry cordial, chocolate and herbs. With very little new oak influence, the soft, supple fruit flavors are allowed to shine through, giving this wine a real sense of polish.",87,20.0,Washington
66059,Italy,"This wine from the Tiefenbrunner estate at Castel Turmhof is a lively, crisp, fresh style of wine, with flavors of green peppers and mint, and good acidity.",86,21.0,Northeastern Italy
66060,US,"From the winery's estate Bell Mountain ranch, a stretch of vineyard that reaches through Alexander Valley to the Russian River Valley, this is mostly Cabernet Sauvignon, blended with Merlot, Cabernet Franc and Petit Verdot. Tight in cranberry and puckering oak, it needs to air before enjoying.",84,42.0,California
66061,US,"This is a great Napa Valley Merlot, from a winery with a generally good track record with the variety. The grapes were grown in the Coombsville region, although they were allowed to get very ripe, resulting in fairly high alcohol and rich cherry, berry, dark chocolate and anise flavors. It's notable for grippy tannins that give it a firm, dry mouthfeel.",92,42.0,California
66062,France,"Aromas of white cherry and strawberry lead the nose of this wine, with hints of peach and honeydew that lend richness. A mentholated thread adds interest to the palate, alongside a soft astringency that couples with notes of melon rind and citrus peel on the finish.",86,12.0,Languedoc-Roussillon
66063,US,"This estate vineyard in the heart of the appellation provides this wine with a generosity of spirit and flavor, all within a light-bodied package of elegance and restraint. Pear and applesauce give it a fruity edge of ripe round flavor that's likable and nourished by touches of citrus. The finish is as crisp as a lime chaser.",91,55.0,California
66064,US,"Plump blackberries, grapeseed, pencil lead and a touch of smoke converge on this blend of Syrah, Merlot, Zinfandel, Cabernet Sauvignon and Cabernet Franc. The flavors are woody, with cedar, tart elderberry and pencil lead, while the structure is chalky and tannic. It's a heavy-duty sip, with beef char lingering into the cooked-fruit finish.",88,65.0,California
66065,US,"Deeply purple aromas of acai fruit and grape Jolly Rancher candies get a bit more serious with the scent of smoked cigars. The grape-juice element carries to the easy-to-drink, not overly complex palate, which will work well with food or just by itself.",88,54.0,California
66066,France,"Opulent, ripe and fruity, this is classic Saint-Aubin. Generous fruitiness is balanced with crisp acidity and touches of minerality and spicy wood. Its fruitiness makes it accessible now, but several years' aging will make it even better and certainly more complex.",91,42.0,Burgundy
66067,US,"Shows enough fanciness to make it worth the price. Although it has no possibilities of improving with age, it's a fine, softly gentle Cabernet to drink now. Shows correct blackberry, black currant and oak flavors.",87,15.0,California
66068,Portugal,"This 100% Syrah Duriense regional wine comes from a vineyard in the Douro Superior. It has dark tannins and the same mineral structure as a Douro wine made from Portuguese grapes. Black fruits are contrasted with immense acidity and tannins. The wine is still young, and will be best from 2018.",92,35.0,Duriense
66069,US,"A very rich Chardonnay that's creamy and smooth in the mouth. A touch of oak and lees gives weight and density to the lime and peach fruit, while brisk acidity contributes brightness. A great price for a wine of this distinction.",92,21.0,California
66070,US,"Estate grown, this 100% Syrah has excellent concentration and round, mouthfilling fruit flavors. Cherries and plums are highlighted with baking spices and a finishing wash of rich mocha. Very tasty, forward, and drinking at its best right now.",90,24.0,Washington

66072,Portugal,"When it was planted with Bordeaux grapes in 1974, this vineyard was a first in Portugal. It continues to produce great wines, with this is the latest release. It is sophisticated and rich, while also finely structured. Its wood aging lifts the wine and adds spice and density. As with past vintages, this wine needs to age. Drink after 2020.",94,38.0,Península de Setúbal
66073,US,"A solid coastal Pinot. Shows lots of typicity in the dryness, crisp acidity and earthy, mushroomy flavors of cherries, and the way the tannins scour the palate. Drinks a bit hard now. Give it a year or two in the cellar.",88,44.0,California

66077,South Africa,"A touch overripe and indulgent, this Chard needs a little more vibrancy to enliven its heavy character. Mushy peaches, banana and mealy cantaloupe emanate from the bouquet while flavors of buttered popcorn and oaky spice dominate the palate. Try with a heavy cream-based dish to downplay the wine's own richness.",86,25.0,Stellenbosch
66078,Germany,"Despite some initially offputting scents of sweaty socks, this is a charming wine. Apple, citrus and petrol mingle easily once the difficult aromas have dissipated to reveal a medium-bodied, off-dry wine. It's creamy-textured in the mouth, then turns crisp and minerally on the finish.",89,22.0,Mosel-Saar-Ruwer
66079,US,"Named after the winemaker's newborn son, Enzo is a bold unabashedly unique take on Finger Lakes Riesling in the hands of a Long Island producer. Made from grapes frozen on the vine and fermented via indigenous yeast in French oak, it's intensely spicy, wafting of caramel and candied orange rinds. The palate is unctuously honeyed but dusted by layers of earth and mineral. It's a far departure from a classic ice wine yet intriguingly complex and impeccably balanced.",90,50.0,New York
66080,US,"If your tastes run to fruit-driven, all-stainless, crisp and steely Chardonnays, this is a great choice. Bright pineapple and citrus fruit flavors abound, and the acids, though substantial, are juicy and natural. The balance, freshness and overall value put this among best of class.",90,22.0,Oregon
66081,US,"Still coming into its own, this blend of Syrah (60%) and Cabernet Sauvignon from top sites Grand Ciel, Ciel du Cheval, Upchurch and Klipsun vineyards offers reticent notes of blackberries, herbs and roasted meat. It's loaded with rich, powerful dark fruit flavors that linger on the finish.",91,39.0,Washington
66082,France,"This is a ripe, beautifully structured wine. It has acidity and rich yellow and lime fruitiness that are touched by wood and channeled into a wine that is smooth and generous. The acidity keeps this balanced, structured wine on a straight line of pure fruitiness.",90,,Burgundy
66083,France,"This is a really fruity rosé with refreshing red currant and raspberry fruit flavors. They are blended with a crisp, dusty texture that offers both an herbaceous and a fuller character. The extra richness makes this a food rosé.",88,,Loire Valley
66084,US,"This small-production Pinot is ripe and intense. It immediately strikes you with the sheer opulence of its cherry and blueberry flavors. But the structure is immaculate, with pure, refined tannins, plus bright, zesty acids. It has a lot of alcohol, and the wine is a bit warm, but Pinot-friendly foods like steak and lamb will help to balance it. Drink now–2016.",93,80.0,California
66085,US,"Velvety and brooding, this vineyard-designate is complex and well structured, memorable in its combination of savory earth, black tea and cranberry-rhubarb. It has a dense body and concentrated texture, which present as voluptuous on the palate.",91,62.0,California

66087,US,"Don't look for grassy or herbaceous flavors, because there is not a trace of either. This is a stand-alone style that turns the usually snarly, gooseberry-flavored Sauvignon Blanc grape into a honeyed pussycat, ripe and   tropical and slightly sweet, with a toffee candy finish.",90,20.0,Washington
66088,Canada,"This barrel-fermented Chardonnay offers subtle layers of flavor, weaving hints of leafy green herb, lemon skin and oil, together with suggestions of white peach. It's structured for drinking now and through 2021, with an elegant frame and modest proportions.",89,41.0,British Columbia

66090,Italy,"This blend of Teroldego and Lagrein isn't very expressive but the the nose eventually reveals black fruit and smoke. The palate is also closed, but eventually opens enough to show cherry, blackberry and hints of oak-driven spice.",86,,Northeastern Italy
66091,US,"This estate-grown wine comes from the vineyard that provides the backbone to the producer's well-known Les Pommiers Pinot Noir. Tart in rhubarb, pomegranate and plush, herb-kissed red fruit, it's juicy and young, complex yet approachable. Full bodied and grainy in tannin, it'll provide years of pleasure for drinkers who can wait.",92,85.0,California

66097,US,"This is impressively dark, with dense but grapy fruit flavors right out front. The mouthfeel is sharp and spicy, and it thins out surprisingly in the middle, given the color and rather high alcohol. Sappy acids and raspy tannins carry it through the finish.",88,24.0,Oregon
66098,US,"Intense aromas of smoke, spice and toast envelop layers of ripe blackberry and currant in this penetrating Cabernet Sauvignon. It's boldly oaked but elegantly balanced, bolstering without overpowering the fruit. Dark herb notes and bristling acidity lead an elegant, delicately tannic finish.",90,40.0,New York
66099,France,"This Tavel rosé contains six grape varieties, although 80% of the blend is Grenache and Cinsault. Despite ample weight on the palate, the result is a bit chalky on the finish, with flavors of underripe berries and melon.",87,19.0,Rhône Valley
66100,US,"This stylishly labeled wine by Adam Lazarre and Christian Tietje shows salted apples, lime blossoms and white flowers on the nose. The energetic palate offers just-cut green pears at first, then opens into a touch of vanilla. It tightens back down on green apple peels before ending with vanilla cream. The wine delivers a full experience.",91,20.0,California
66101,US,"Grapes from two vineyards—Hyland in the McMinnville AVA, and Fortmiller in the Rogue Valley AVA—combine gracefully in a young wine with juicy citrus and ripe blackberry flavors. Eleven months in 40% new French oak adds dark chocolate around the typical earthy minerality of the Hyland fruit. There are substantial tannins, so give this extra aeration, or cellar for another few years.",90,34.0,Oregon
66102,US,"Sagemoor and Conner Lee grapes go into this soft, plush, totally drinkable Chardonnay. Pretty fruit flavors of banana, apple and pear mingle seamlessly, and the wine has both balance and texture to spare. Drink it now for its poise and freshness.",90,23.0,Washington
66103,France,"A wonderfully subtle touch of chamomile and yarrow appears first. This is followed by tart apple and citrus notes that also play vividly on the palate.

The depth of flavor, with that herbal tang, remains beguiling from the start to the long, long finish.",94,40.0,Alsace

66105,US,"The aromas on this Rocks District wine pop with huckleberry, black and green olive, plum and mineral. It's dazzlingly polished and textured in feel, with nuanced, detailed smoked meat and savory flavors. It nonetheless retains an exquisite sense of balance and restraint, capped off by an outrageously long finish.",93,42.0,Washington
66106,US,"Long-time admirers of this wine may find the 2011 version a bit thin. It's a more subtle wine than is customary, the expressive funk subsumed below lighter layers of peat moss, sea salt and white chocolate. With decanting, scents of shittake mushroom, duck sauce and even chicken broth swirl up from the glass, with black tea flavors running through the tannins. Quite good, yet somewhat muted.",93,95.0,Oregon
66107,US,"Heavy and dense in the mouth, with rich flavors of grilled blackberries, pepper and a lovely addition of toasted oak. Nice and dry, but a bit too soft, and would benefit from greater structure.",87,35.0,California

66109,Chile,"Tight, angular aromas of cranberry, red plum, crushed mineral and dried leaves lead to a tough palate with black fruit flavors led by prune. A very concentrated, powerful wine based on Carignan and Syrah, with lemony oak and pounding tannins. Should be more tame by now; hold another year or two, and keep your fingers crossed.",87,27.0,Central Valley
66110,US,"Soft and fruity, with a balanced mix of tropical fruit flavors—banana and pineapple—and juicy caramel, this appealing Chardonnay is drinking perfectly. There is just enough green apple tang to the finish to keep it fresh and focused through the finish.",88,14.0,Washington

66113,Argentina,"Neutral aromas of apple and peach kick it off, then round citrus and a mild hint of pickled vegetable and apple carry the palate. This is a fleshy, basic Chardonnay with youthful bounce and a touch of additional pickle on the finish. Drink soon.",84,10.0,Mendoza Province
66114,France,"Named after the steep slopes that back the Bourgeois winery, this powerful, concentrated wine shows both wonderful white and yellow fruits and a mineral character that gives a superb tension. Packed with fruit and impressively textured, it can still age. Drink from 2017.",93,35.0,Loire Valley
66115,Argentina,"Opens with earthy, leafy aromas that can best be described as “mature.” Throw in tobacco and baked plum, and the picture is complete. The palate is concentrated and tight, with sweet, herbal berry flavors and caramel on the finish. Rugged and herbal as a whole but with good qualities; 50% Cabernet with 40% Merlot and 10% Malbec.",86,20.0,Mendoza Province
66116,France,"Fruity and crisp, this is a ripe, refreshing wine. Lively acidity sets off the full strawberry and red-currant fruits. The aftertaste continues the fruity theme with tangy orange-zest flavors.",90,25.0,Provence

66120,US,"A very expressive and full-bodied wine. It jolts the palate with the purest extract of ripe limes, green apples and minerals. Wonderfully sharp acids push the flavors up and out, and cleanse the palate. Rather lean, compared to some of the fatties out there, a wine of structure and firmness..",91,38.0,California
66121,US,"Barrel aromas of vanilla, coconut and toast are at the fore followed by luxurious coffee and plum flavors that linger. Grainy tannins back it all up.",88,18.0,Washington
66122,US,"This Chardonnay is creamy and scented with vanilla, ripe apple and pineapple. The fruit has a slightly overripe quality, a suggestion of funk on the finish, and the vanilla seems artificial. It says unoaked, but that's a lot of vanilla nonetheless.",84,12.0,Oregon
66123,US,"A crowd-pleasing quaffer of a wine, this is tart, with a fresh-squeezed lemon palate that also offers anise, caramel apple and pear. Crisp and dry, it indeed sees no oak—it's pure, with a lasting finish.",90,20.0,California

66127,Chile,"Saturated, extracted and heavy, with as many flaws as it has positives. The nose is reduced and saucy, with aromas of roasted tomato, horseradish, prune, tobacco and molasses. The feel leans toward thick, with flavors of chocolate, leather, cassis and blackberry carrying a saucy, herbal underbelly. A decent but disjointed combo of Shiraz (70%), Cabernet Sauvignon (25%) and Merlot (5%).",85,23.0,Limarí Valley
66128,US,"Lusty and fleshy, a fat, opulently flavored young Cab offering huge amounts of ripe Paso fruit. Floods the mouth with soft, somewhat one-dimensional flavors of blackberries, cherries, currants and sandalwood.",87,34.0,California
66129,Chile,"Rustic and medium-bodied, this Merlot has a nice spiciness that would be a big hit at a backyard barbecue. There's some char on the nose, and a spicy-marinade note on the palate. Finishes with dryish tannins and outdoorsy, tree-bark flavors.",85,12.0,Maipo Valley
66130,US,"Savory and tart, this is a dry, expressive white, varietal in nature, that offers tart tightly wound flavors of quince, white peach and lemon. A back note of freshly cut grass teases the nose and palate.",87,28.0,California

66132,France,"From one of the properties owned by the Chanfreau family of neighboring Château Fonréaud, Chemin-Royal is dominated by new wood flavors that give the wine a toasty edge. At this stage, it is difficult to taste the fruit, but the wine has weight, which should develop through the tannins.",90,,Bordeaux
66133,US,"The vineyard is on Howell Mountain. It's an awkward wine, with lots to like, but some problems. On the plus side is enormous  cassis, cherry and chocolate fruit flavor and rich, fine tannins, and the 100% new oak seems proper given the wine's volume. But there's too much sugary sweetness in the finish, almost like a dessert wine.",85,75.0,California
66134,US,"Full, complex bouquet of dark berries, tobacco and smoke, with a cool pine note adding interest. Similar flavors follow on the palate, and the texture is lean and refined, with very good fruit-to-acid balance.

66137,US,"Practically a liquid fruit salad, this smells and tastes like orange, apple, cantaloupe and banana. The texture is smooth and rounded, rather than crisp. A little buttery flavor comes through on the finish.",85,18.0,California
66138,US,"De Sante has produced a wine that goes beyond the usual Sauvignon Blanc. It has good varietal character, with adequate acidity backing up citrus, melon, fig and tropical fruit flavors. But there's a structural complexity that must be due to Napa Valley's terroir.",87,22.0,California
66139,Argentina,"Big and purple, with sweet aromas. But the palate is very uneven, with acute acidity that scours and turns the plum and grape flavors sour. Grabby mouthfeel as well, with clamp.",80,8.0,Mendoza Province

66147,US,"You've got to love the exotic aromas, great balance and firm texture of this complex Pinot.

66148,New Zealand,"Even Brancott's entry-level Sauvignon Blanc is a solid effort, adding a hint of fumé character to its otherwise straightforward blend of stone and passion fruit.

66152,US,"Half of this Bordeaux-style blend is Cabernet Sauvignon, the other half a blend of Merlot, Cab Franc and Petit Verdot.

66156,US,"The 2008 vintage presented challenges for Cabernet Sauvignon, but this Cabernet Franc-based blend succeeds wildly. It's bone dry, tannic and enormously complex, with flavors of sour-cherry candy, red currant, licorice and spicy cola. Ninety-five percent new oak lends this a wonderful toastiness. Few wines could handle that much new wood, but this one can. However, it's very tannic. You can drink it now, but it should blossom after 2014.",97,450.0,California

66162,US,"Founded by a well-heeled group of wine afficionadoes, Barons has seen a change of ownership and a change in winemaking direction. For the first time, French oak has begun to supplant American oak as the barrels of choice. The wine is aromatic, detailed and inviting, with the lower alcohol prevalent in 2011.

66186,New Zealand,"The Matariki style of late harvest wine is to avoid overly sugary renditions in favor of balance. In this, the 2000 succeeds admirably, combining bergamot, pineapple and apricot flavors in a lightly sweet yet tart wine. Best with fresh fruit and cheeses, as it's not rich enough to match with anything sweeter.",87,30.0,Hawke's Bay
66187,France,Minty aromas reflect the new wood that was used to age this wine. Its red berry fruitiness recalls the vintage while its firm tannins will allow it to age for several years. It comes from the western end of the Entre-deux-Mers region. Drink from 2019.,88,15.0,Bordeaux
66188,US,"Initially a bit funky, this wine opened up to offer pretty cassis and fresh blackberry fruit couched in a bed of medium acid and soft tannins. Mushroom and plum tones on the finish hang around for just a bit. Drink up.",83,25.0,Colorado
66189,US,"Delicious in its own way, with a soft, gentle mouthfeel framing upfront flavors of raspberry, cherry, vanilla, toast and pie spice. Drink now with a steak or a lamb chop.",88,60.0,California
66190,France,"Now definitely mature, even drying up, this wine needs to be drunk now. It has developed a dry, tannic character, woody and stalky, although its balance is still there and the aftertaste has some juiciness.",84,60.0,Bordeaux
66191,Chile,"Fiery and wild at first, with aromas of cinnamon, pepper and Juicy Fruit gum. Strange as that may sound, the wine finds a more familiar place on the palate, where plum, cherry and cassis flavors are flashy and the feel is a bit clangy. Rounds out with air and settles down fairly nicely.",86,18.0,Curicó Valley
66192,US,"This blend, which is mainly Zinfandel and Cabernet Sauvignon, is robust. It's a trattoria or bistro wine, dry, tannic and spicy, with earthy flavors. Drink now with rich foods to tease out the berry fruit.",88,48.0,California
66193,US,"A blend of 85% Cabernet Sauvignon with 15% Merlot, this was built to be approachable young. Grapes are sourced from an estate, organically farmed vineyard as well as two neighboring properties, Pickberry and Murray Ranch. Tobacco forms around a juiciness of blackberry and raspberry, giving it a sultry edge, while maintaing soft tannins throughout.",90,40.0,California
66194,US,"Huckleberry, blackberry, coffee and bramble aromas lead to full-bodied fruit and barrel flavors in this wine. It's appealing despite the heavy-handed oak.",89,35.0,Washington

66196,Spain,"A warm vintage (2006) may be causing this wine to expire prematurely, but tasted in 2008 it seems to be losing its drive. The nose has wild flower and melon aromas, while the palate shows simple apricot, pineapple and mango flavors. The tropical notes are here, but the texture is watery and as a whole it doesn't go the extra yard.",85,14.0,Northern Spain
66197,US,"A good grip of acidity and tannins shape the fruity, earthy aromas and crisp raspberry and cranberry flavors. It's a very lively, refreshing style that is not overripe, and will be great with all kinds of food.",88,30.0,California
66198,US,"Lush aromas of melon, mango and pineapple are pristine and primary on this delicate, brisk Riesling. Off dry in style, it's a straightforward yet irresistibly juicy thirst quencher sure to please a wide audience.",87,17.0,New York
66199,US,"Quite good, but some vegetal flavors mar this dessert wine, which is very sweet, with 18% residual sugar. Such sweetness is usually enough to satisfy on its own, but despite the apricot, tangerine and vanilla flavors, a stubborn green streak lowers the score.",87,40.0,California
66200,France,"Tight, snappy and linear, this is a clean and refreshing rosé that's a perfect pairing for light fare or dining al fresco. Notes of white melon, cherry and strawberry hull dance on the nose and palate, with underpinnings of white flowers and fresh savory herbs. The medium acidity lends good cut to the mouthfeel, finishing bright and juicy.",89,18.0,Languedoc-Roussillon
66201,US,"Just-cracked, yeasty sourdough bread and dried lemon-skin aromas float off of this bottle-aged sparkler from an esteemed, longtime producer. Her winemaker son named this wine in honor of her birth year. An oxidative warmth gives bready depth to the palate, which shows lots of toast and lemon marmalade flavors.",90,50.0,California
66202,US,"Hard tannins, dryness and brisk acidity can't hide the enormous core of blackberries and currants. It was clearly grown in a cool climate. The wine doesn't seem likely to develop, so drink soon, with barbecue to cut through the tannins.",88,32.0,California
66203,US,"Everything in this full-bodied wine comes in big helpings, from the deep garnet color to aromas of rich oak and ripe fruit, to the mouthfilling black-cherry flavors. Yet it doesn't go over the top and achieves a high-level complexity that's delicious.",90,75.0,California
66204,US,"From Atlas Peak sites, this is a dark, brooding wine rich in earthy loam, pomegranate, cranberry and cherry that carries a fistful of weight and power. The oaky finish could use more time to resolve. Drink now through 2020.",90,28.0,California
66205,US,"Very high alcohol gives this wine a hot, jalapeño pepper burn. Based on Zinfandel, the blend also includes Syrah and Petite Sirah. It's a rugged, rustic wine that would shine with a richly-sauced barbecue for balance.",86,34.0,California
66206,US,"Big, bold, dark and chewy, this builds upon substantial black-cherry fruit and supporting acids. Still knitting together, it shows highlights of cedar and tobacco, along with thick tannins. Give this a couple more years of bottle age, and drink after 2018.",91,50.0,Oregon

66208,France,"Clos Ste Hune comes from a small parcel in the Rosacker Grand Cru vineyard. It is a wonderful, ethereal paean to Riesling—crisp while intensely perfumed with aromas of fennel and licorice. It's dry in style, with elegant citrus flavors and a straight line of steely acidity, but finishes with a hint of honey. While delicious now, it's not quite mature and could continue to improve until 2025.",96,,Alsace
66209,France,"Soft tannins and a rounded texture make this wine almost drinkable now. The smooth structure only slowly shows tannins and acidity. A fresh, raspberry fruit character will allow the wine to develop. Drink now, although better from 2017.",89,41.0,Burgundy
66210,US,"Here's a clean, brisk Sauvignon Blanc for pairing with Asian fare. It's spicy and overtly sweet, with lemongrass, honey and vanilla flavors.",85,12.0,California
66211,Italy,"A lovely, wine, with aromas of red cherry, violet and hints of underbrush. The palate delivers succulent wild cherry, cinnamon and natural vanilla flavors with hint of truffle. It has compelling depth but needs time to tame the structured yet elegant tannins. Drink 2016–2025.",93,20.0,Tuscany
66212,Mexico,"Sauvignon Blanc is, in general, one of Baja's more consistent performers. This version is light in color, with varietally familiar aromas of nettle, grapefruit and passion fruit. It's a bit weighty, with apple, grapefruit and tropical flavors. A mild bitterness can be found on the finish.",87,15.0,Valle de Guadalupe
66213,US,"Though labeled as Merlot, this smells more like Syrah which makes up 20% of the blend, with aromas of blue and purple fruit along with whiffs of smoked meat and dried herb. The fruit flavors are sweet and plump, backed by soft, luxurious tannins. It's enjoyable but doesn't seem varietally correct.",87,12.0,Washington
66214,US,"The texture is delicately silky and the acidity is brisk and savory. What stars are the flavors. The wine is jammy in raspberries and cherries and a little obvious in its fruit and oak. Doesn't seem to be an ager, so drink up.",88,55.0,California
66215,US,"Crushed bricks, rose petals, red currants and grape syrup are sprinkled with elegant black spices in this blend of 80% Sangiovese and 20% Merlot by Steve and Chrystal Clifton. The palate is silky, redolent with mulberry and tart plums skins, amped up by sagebrush and thyme. It's perfect for a variety of foods.",91,32.0,California
66216,US,"A crowd-pleasing Chardonnay aromatically suggestive of candied fruit and dried apricot, it offers a healthy dose of minerality amidst a well-composed structure. Striking the right balance between fleshy and firm, it'll go well with just about anything.",89,25.0,California
66217,US,"Extended time in all new French oak barrels give this wine a heartier feel than it might otherwise have, swirls of oaky caramel and toast most prominent on the nose and initial palate. A richness of color also stands out, while velvety tannins and red fruit complete the experience. Letting the wine open helps temper its size, revealing a measured level of refinement.",90,60.0,California
66218,US,"Acidity makes the mouth water, tannins provide a firm framework, oak is perfectly integrated, and the depth of fruit is impressive. Shows flavors of cherry tart, raspberry Newton, cola, buttered cinnamon toast and vanilla that are magnificent and decadent. Elegant and classy. Should negotiate the years through 2014.",95,85.0,California

66220,US,"A terrific vintage for the Freedom Hill bottling, the 2008 displays a firm, concentrated core of cranberry, raspberry and pie-cherry fruit flavors. Wrapped in plenty of toasty new oak, the wine is powerful and mouth-coating, balanced with juicy acidity, and rolls on through a lengthy, satisfying finish.",92,40.0,Oregon
66221,Chile,"Tarry, briary, gritty aromas take some getting used to. This blend of Grenache, Mourvèdre, Syrah, Carignan and Marsanne conveys sharp, juicy acidity. Flavors of currant, red plum and spice finish on the racy and raw side, with herbal notes and a lasting peppery flavor.",89,45.0,Aconcagua Valley
66222,Italy,"Syrah from central Tuscany? Sure. The '98 version of Colvecchio, an offering from a hot year, is leaner than might be expected and short on dimension. It has lots of oak up front and an abundance of spicy, tart red fruit in the middle. The oak kicks up on the finish as well. The effort is there and the fruit seems sound, but tartness is the overriding impression it leaves.",86,36.0,Tuscany
66223,France,"Big, and powerful, this has generous flavors of yellow fruit, pear and integrated spice. It has weight to go with its more fruity character. With wood influence, refreshing acidity and a suggestion of tannin, it will age over the next 2–3 years.",90,,Burgundy
66224,US,"Good for its apricot, vanilla and buttercream flavors, but really lacks the sweet richness that an expensive dessert wine needs. It falls apart mid-palate, and turns watery on the finish.",84,28.0,California
66225,US,"Made for the first time in this vintage, this young wine is tight and brambly, with tart, peppery berry fruit. Chewy tannins denote its youth, and the finish delivers outstanding depth. If it follows the path of other Ayoub Pinots, this will benefit greatly from further bottle age.",93,55.0,Oregon
66226,France,"This is a rich, round and full-bodied wine with smooth, creamy apple and pear flavors. It is cut through with zingy lemon acidity and a touch of honey. The structure comes from a cool line of lemon zest, minerality and a tight, taut aftertaste. Drink from 2017.",93,55.0,Burgundy
66227,Chile,"A touch mossy and herbal on the nose, but also poised, balanced and inviting. The palate is juicy and incorporates good mouthfeel, and the flavors of spiced plum have character. Finishes with pepper and toast along with mild tannic bite. Imported by Great Wines Corpora U.S.",89,22.0,Aconcagua Valley
66228,US,"From an organically farmed estate vineyard in Chiles Valley operated by the same family for more than 40 years, this 87% Cabernet Sauvignon-13% Merlot has soul and structure, as well a stony minerality that compels. Menthol and tobacco weave between thick layers of dark cherry and plum, complemented on the palate by exotic cardamom and clove. This is one worth cellaring through 2022 or giving an hour or two to open.",93,50.0,California
66229,France,"A solid wine, finely constructed, its chunky tannins blending well with the red-plum-juice flavors. The acidity is important, along with the tasty cherry texture. Age for 3–4 years.",91,120.0,Burgundy
66230,Germany,"Scents of honey and freshly pressed apples waft from this delicate sweet Riesling. Bright, sunny peach flavor dominates the palate, but is pierced with a startling vein of lemon acidity. Finishes a savory with lingering notes of pollen and spice.",91,95.0,Mosel

The palate delivers a delicious blackberry core, layered with cinnamon, white pepper and nutmeg accents. This is well balanced, with velvety tannins and fresh acidity.",91,38.0,Veneto
66234,Spain,"Dusty spice and red-berry aromas are a fine opening to this blend of Garnacha, Carignan, Cab Sauvignon and Syrah. It's fairly full bodied but not heavy, with fine balance and bright flavors of cherry and berry that come in layered waves. A toasty, dry finish with spice and good acidity closes out this easy-to-like Spanish red. Drink through 2017.",91,22.0,Catalonia
66235,US,"Lots of ripe strawberries, raspberries and sweet smoky oak in this silky young Pinot Noir. It tastes a bit too extracted and jammy for subtlety, but sure does offer a mouthful of flavor.",87,50.0,California
66236,US,"Given its modest price and weighty alcohol, this wine should find many admirers. Thick and tannic, it could pass for a heavier red than Pinot Noir, and it offers bulky, rustic fruit flavors, with some heat on the finish.",86,25.0,Oregon
66237,France,"This is a soft, fresh while rounded wine. A gentle texture hints at a more tangy character while pushing the apple and spice flavors forward. Attractive now, the wine is ready to drink.",88,37.0,Burgundy
66238,US,"Concentrated lavender and incense aromas make for a woody perfume on the nose of this appellation blend, giving lots of character to the core of cherry syrup. The palate shows the same levels of intense incense and purple flowers, which nearly overpowers the cranberry and pomegranate fruits.",89,32.0,California
66239,France,"Mint and herb aromas are followed by a structured and tannic palate. It has balancing acidity, with a juicy black-currant flavor and a dark, dry edge. Like nearly all of the 2010s, it needs to age.",87,16.0,Bordeaux
66240,France,"A touch of sweet spice jazzes up the nose, giving lift to the lightly baked apple and yellow peach characteristics. The round, medium-bodied palate has lively acidity and a sweet orange-oil flavored finish.",86,15.0,Languedoc-Roussillon

66242,France,"Ripe and richly fruity, the wine is full bodied with great acidity as well as firm tannins. It will keep for many years. Bold tannins and a fine tension between the fruit and acidity are all promising for the future. Drink this impressive wine from 2025.",94,120.0,Bordeaux
66243,Argentina,"Leafy aromas of tomato and green herbs pile on the pyrazines. This distinctly herbal Cabernet is full and chunky in feel, with flavors that follow the nose: bell pepper and spicy tomato lead the way. A peppery finish is herbal to the last note.",83,15.0,Mendoza Province
66244,France,"Old Merlot vines from a five-acre parcel have given this powerful and dense wine. Solid with dark-plum fruits and still-dry tannins, it also has a fine texture and freshness to balance. It is juicy while also young. Drink from 2018.",90,30.0,Bordeaux

66247,Italy,"Underbrush, dark berry, scorched earth and spice aromas emerge on this full-bodied red.

Drink 2017–2026.",94,88.0,Veneto

66250,US,"The aromas of ripe peach, honeysuckle and jasmine are bright. It's medium sweet and finishes with a floral soap flourish. It needs more acid to stand it up but goes down easy.",85,9.0,Washington
66251,US,"To call this wine huge is an understatement. Blended from Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, Malbec, Petit Verdot, Syrah and Carmenère, its most notable feature is tannins. It's hard, dry and astringent, making it difficult to appreciate now. But there's a gigantic core of blackberries and black currants. With richness like this, it should age and improve through 2020 at least.",91,70.0,California
66252,US,"The Cowgirl Cab, a blend of Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot, is DaMa's most popular offering. Loaded with bright, brambly berry fruits, licorice and loam, it's notable also for smooth, silky tannins.",90,21.0,Washington

66255,US,"A 50-50 Cabernet/Syrah blend, this is heavily tannic. The cherry-cola flavor is smothered in char, smoke and bitter espresso. This needs a big thick steak to cut through the tannins.",83,25.0,Washington
66256,Chile,"Minty and lean on the nose, with tangy, borderline sour red-fruit flavors. There's a little toast, licorice and bitterness to darken things up, but by then the game is pretty much lost. Finishes sharp as well.",83,13.0,Molina
66257,France,"This is a warm wine with a rounded feel, making it soft and full of red fruits. It features strawberry sweetness as well as a tighter, more tannic character. It could well age, so wait until 2016.",90,27.0,Burgundy

66262,US,"Crushed black currant meets with turned earth and black pepper on this interesting blend of 50% Syrah, 25% Cabernet Franc and 25% Merlot.

66270,US,"The fruit on this Pinot Noir is flashier than anything that MacPhail has produced in their Sonoma County Pinots. That likely is due to the long hangtime of the Santa Rita Hills. The grapes got enormously ripe and rich in raspberries and cherries, and the wine would be a simple fruit bomb were it not for the excellent structure and a certain tangy minerality that will help it age through 2020 to 2022.",92,49.0,California
66271,US,"Smoke and char notes lend a savory, dark tone to cheerful red-cherry and sweet-spice flavors in this oaky, full-bodied Bordeaux blend. The palate is penetrating with juicy, primary fruit, but finishes a bit green and woody.",85,35.0,New York
66272,US,"A vivid buttered-popcorn aroma and luscious vanilla and lemon-meringue flavors make this wine frothy and mouthfilling.

66273,US,"Grapefruit rind, yogurt, sour cream and warm pear show on the nose of this bottling. There is great acidity on the sip, with a mango cream and tropical fruit touch, but those elements coalesce into a rich, roasted-almond-driven palate as the wine breathes.",92,30.0,California
66274,US,"Intensely aromatic, with loads of sunny peach, apricot and yellow flower aromas, this off-dry Riesling is ripe and concentrated, yet impeccably structured. So fruity, it's almost tropical on the palate, but it finishes dry and crisp, with penetrating lemon-lime acidity.",89,16.0,New York
66275,US,"This wine is half Merlot with the rest Cabernet Sauvignon (31%), Cabernet Franc (16%), Petit Verdot (2%) and Malbec. It draws you into the glass with high-toned aromas of dried herbs, espresso, red and black fruit, along with floral notes.

66277,New Zealand,"This doesn't have the same floral notes on the nose as the other 2014s from Escarpment, but instead offers aromas of baking spices, vanilla and black cherries.

66280,US,"Being 100% varietal, aromas of barrel spice are prominent at present, followed by black fruit.

66281,US,"Expressive in oak, earth and clove with cinnamon-cola, this savory, complex wine is also impressive in its ability to offer crisp and focused lines of citrus and fresh-picked raspberry.

66282,US,"Made for broad release, this wine impresses for its rounded, approachable layers of dried herb and anise, the tannin and oak lightly applied. Blended with 10% Merlot, it finds a jolt of richness on the finish, a showcase for notions of chocolate, cherry and blackberry.",90,25.0,California

66286,US,"Extremely dark in the glass, lavish aromas of black currant, black pepper, lilac, violet and blooming chaparral show on this bottling from a remote vineyard north of the Santa Maria Valley. It's a smooth sip at first, with ripe elderberry and black fruit, but the tannins stiffen quickly to reveal a masculine wine, with peppery spice, rounded vanilla and a strong acidic slice cutting through the density.",94,48.0,California
66287,US,"This wine is in the “velvet” school of red blends, showing a very supple, rich texture and a definite level of sweetness to soften the overall impact. It has sweet-seeming aromas like maple syrup and blackberry jam, and ripe fruits on the palate too.",86,14.0,America
66288,US,"With its big, hard tannins, this is one for the cellar. There's a certain austerity that suggests the rocky soils of this mountain vineyard. But the fruit, packed into a dense core, is ripe and suggestive of blackberry and cherries. The youthful brawniness softens after some time in the glass or decanter, but you're best off aging it until 2019 or so.",93,67.0,California

66403,Spain,"A dense, baked, raisiny nose is ultra ripe but also a bit flabby and damp-smelling.

Roses and black tea provide savory flavor, with an intensity of forest floor.",88,75.0,California
66407,Chile,"Rubbery blackberry aromas are concentrated but blunt. This has a pinched, saucy feel that's related to high acidity. Saucy, rubbery flavors of blackberry show graphite and raw oak accents in front of an earthy, almost briny finish.",87,18.0,Limarí Valley

66409,Australia,"The Smith Cullam Riesling is made in a large French oak cask in an off-dry style. The 2012 is higher in alcohol than the 2011, yet also seems sweeter.

66422,France,"The wine is tight and closed, hiding its natural fruitiness. For the moment, what is showing is acidity and a strongly mineral texture. This complex wine needs aging to fill out the structure. Drink from 2017.",91,38.0,Burgundy

66434,Australia,"Medium-bodied and a little viscous in the mouth, this value Chard is no fruit bomb, as are many others at this price. It's rather interesting—look for white stone fruit and floral notes on the palate, and peach and passion fruit notes on the nose. Finishes with a peppery-herbaceous bite.",86,8.0,Australia Other
66435,France,"Firm and tight, a wine that reveals more structure than fruit initially, leaving the citrus and grapefruit flavors to emerge later. Then it closes up again, keeping some of the mineral austerity. Keep this wine for a year.",90,,Burgundy

The palate comes in with concentrated zestiness—there almost is a sobering edge of bitter pith that pulls us towards the earth while the soaring lemon and grapefruit notes lift towards the light. This is fruitful promise and airy spirit, earthy depth and boundless richness. All this comes as a bundled force of joy, freshness and utter pleasure.

Drink 2022–2040.",97,66.0,Alsace
66441,US,"This delightful and refreshing wine is atypical in all the right ways. Intensely aromatic, it conveys a lush mix of honeysuckle, sweet hay, smoke, lime and honeydew melon.

66448,US,"An ambitious blend of Merlot, Tempranillo, Malbec and Cabernet Sauvignon, grown mainly on Atlas Peak. It's bone dry and locked down in tannins and acidity, offering little relief, but there's a potent core of blackberries and black currants that yearns to bust through. Clearly well grown, it could be an ager, but predictions are risky.",92,60.0,California

66455,US,"Superripe and flamboyant, as you'd expect from the vintage, bursting with plum, blackberry, tobacco, sage and green olive flavors, and the tannins are a wonder. Velvety soft and luxurious in the mouth. A trace of acidic bitterness in the finish loses a few points.",90,17.0,California

66457,US,"Produced by John Grochau (Grochau Cellars), this is stubbornly shut down, with hints of rubber tire in the aromas. Once you work past the reductive scents and flavors, it's a short wine with generic fruit and a quick finish.",85,29.0,Oregon
66458,US,"This makes a nice change from the simply fruity norm. The color is a traditional light garnet with a bronze rim, while the aromas resemble rhubarb and raspberries. Flavors are earthy, savory and meaty rather than straightforward grapy. The texture is rather soft, the tannins muted and the body not too full.",87,50.0,California

66537,Austria,"Incredibly ripe and sweet apricots, candied orange peel, a touch of fresh spearmint and fresh lemon zest all abound on the nose, and are just the first expressions. Balm-like sweetness and clouds of more apricot and peach play on the palate, but electric acidity runs straight through and lends this rich and unctuous TBA the thrilling freshness and streamlined zestiness of candied citrus peel, finishing with long, lip-smacking deliciousness.

66619,US,"The grapes for this beautiful wine come from a sloping, high-elevation site, coaxed into expression by Winemaker Bob Cabral. Barrel-aged 10 months in French oak, 40% of it new, it opens with touches of butter and matchstick before blowing off the doors with butterscotch, baked lemon and balanced, oaky spice. Voluptuous on the palate, this is a stunner.",94,50.0,California
66620,Canada,"The Charmat process, rather than the Champagne method, is used here. It's a clean, light, generic sparkling wine, done as a brut. Use it as an all-purpose mixer for best effect.",85,20.0,Ontario
66621,US,"This unoaked Chard has a somewhat Chablilsienne quality to it, with a beautiful mineral-driven freshness supported by delicate aromas of white peach, green apple and lively orange citrus. Light and immensely refreshing, it's a perfect apértitif sipper to be enjoyed with cheese and crudité.",86,15.0,New York
66622,US,"This is a creamy, compelling Bordelais style of Sauvignon Blanc. Candied lemon peel, dried apple, light honey and and petrol aromas show on the nose. The rich palate offers poached pear, sea salt and preserved lemon flavors, presented on waves of soft, plush texture.",91,45.0,California
66623,Italy,"This wine offers blackberry, raisin and spice aromas upfront, with a whiff of vanilla. The palate shows a dense black-cherry flavor, with accents of white pepper and Asian spice, all wrapped up in a velvety mouthfeel. Bright acidity gives this energy and keeps it lively.",88,26.0,Veneto

66625,France,"This is a rounded wine, full of perfumed fruit and wood flavors. It has a dense texture with ripe, dusty tannins and fine acidity. From the Alliance Bourg co-op, this full-bodied and rich Bordeaux blend will be a fine wine from 2019.",90,40.0,Bordeaux
66626,US,"A delicious fruit bomb, this has all the jammy goodness of blackberry syrup, with just enough tannin and acidity to keep it from being sweet. Smooth on the palate, it's full-bodied, uncomplicated and tasty.",89,17.0,California
66627,France,"Ripe Merlot pushes through the tight tannins that are still evident in this wine. This dark, dry core dominates initially, and needs time to open up to show the vivid black currant flavors, touched with dried fruits and fresh finishing acidity.",88,30.0,Bordeaux
66628,France,"This wine seems thin and rather tight. It has as much acidity as it does fruit, and a dry tannic structure. Not a wine for aging.",83,,Bordeaux
66629,US,"Made with organically grown grapes, this tawny-colored Chardonnay is ready to go. It shows well-evolved flavors of ripe apple and pear, with a cidery finish. Despite the Columbia Valley labeling, it is from Horse Heaven Hills.",87,12.0,Washington
66630,US,"Gothic is the project of a New York-based restaurateur and sommelier team. This spent 10 months in 15% new French oak. Scents and flavors of rubber tire dominate, and the tannins are hard and harsh. Airing it out helps a bit, but the bitterness does not entirely disappear.",85,24.0,Oregon
66631,France,"High toast and burnt wood are initially off-putting. The tannins in the wine are also on the smoky side. However, there is fruit here, offering some balance in this powerful, dry wine, and giving some blackberry juiciness, which gives relief from the intensity of the wood.",87,28.0,Bordeaux
66632,US,"This is a dark, black and brooding wine, full bodied and firmly impacted in tannin. Mountain sage, currant and mocha highlight dense ripe fruit and dustiness that linger with a spiciness of clove on the finish.",91,110.0,California
66633,US,"Lots going on in this softly appealing Cabernet. It's full-bodied and ripe, showing classic Alexander Valley flavors of blackberry jam, chocolate, anise, dried herbs and spices. Will develop bottle complexity over the years while gradually losing fruit.",87,27.0,California

66635,US,"Perfumed in dried herb and cigar, this is a supple, round, high-toned wine, made from largely Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot, with smaller additions of Petit Verdot, Cabernet Franc, Malbec and Dolcetto.

66638,France,"Ripe and fleshy, this wine is firm and dry, but has extra-ripe fruit. Perhaps the fruit is too rich, leaving the wine unbalanced. In the future, it will show fewer tannins and more fruit. Corinne and Charles-Henri Gonet of the Gonet Champagne family bought Bacalan with the intent of restructuring the vineyards, some of which had not been planted for 70 years. The first red vintage was 2001; first white vintage was 2014.",86,96.0,Bordeaux

66643,US,"This blend is 44% Cab Franc, 31% Cabernet Sauvignon, with the rest Merlot. It's stubbornly closed, with aromas of tar, earth and rubber ball rather than fruit. Some brambly berry flavors can be found, but the finish seems hard and slightly bitter.",86,15.0,Washington
66644,France,"The palest color leads to a perfumed, very ready-to-drink wine. It is crisp with fruit that is now softened by a year's aging, offering a touch of caramel along with crushed strawberry flavors. Drink now.",86,27.0,Loire Valley
66645,US,"Harbes' standard-label Merlot offers a plusher, more voluptuous expression of sun-kissed berries and cherries.

Drink now through 2021 to enjoy its fruity forward nature.",90,28.0,New York
66646,France,"With a high proportion (60%) of Merlot, this is a ripe wine while also being structured. It has a dense character that comes from the still young, firm tannins.

66647,US,"Dried fruit aromas of prune, fig and nearly raisin show on the nose of this red, which is enhanced by savory touches of salt, pepper and leather.

66648,US,"This is a mix of grapes from Willamette and Umpqua Valley vineyards. Light and earthy, it has a classic style that echoes a village Burgundy, only with the distinctive hint of tomato leaf that typifies less expensive Oregon Pinots.

66657,US,"Packaged in a lovely, Champagne-like bottle (but without a cage), this is very pretty, with a hint of cherry candy. The palate is round, full and forward. This is a wine to set on the table for a special occasion—but don't wait too long.",89,28.0,Washington

66659,Italy,"Graceful and fragrant, this boasts alluring scents of rose, aromatic herb, flint, red berry and culinary spice. The elegant palate delivers red cherry, strawberry, white pepper and star anise alongside bright acidity and firm, refined tannins. Drink 2018–2026.",93,55.0,Piedmont

66661,France,"Owned by the Bordeaux Castel family, this estate has produced a simple, light wine packed with fruit. It's light and bright, with just a hint of earthiness that takes away from the freshness. The aftertaste adds lemon crispness.",86,20.0,Provence

66663,Austria,"Very dry, crisp, taut and mineral, a tense wine with a streak of green berries and almost achingly fresh acidity. This is certainly a food style of Riesling, too dry for aperitif. Screwcap.",89,26.0,Kremstal

66665,US,"Made in small amounts, this floral, tangy and richly textured white wine offers a depth of honey and caramel that overpowers the prettier, more mineral-driven aspects lurking in the underbelly of body. Youthful, it should come around.",90,42.0,California
66666,Argentina,"Somewhat smoky and earthy on the nose, but also with some harshness that could be chalked up to youth. Acidity is a bit too high and there's some pickle to the bouquet and flavor profile. On the plus side, as it opens core flavors of raspberry and red plum come across as solid.",84,18.0,Mendoza Province
66667,US,"The Frog is a bit reductive, a bit shy in 2009 and needs extra decanting. With proper breathing time, it shows inviting notes of violets and strawberries, and it gains concentration through the midpalate, with additions of cherry and an almost liquid minerality. An almost delicate version of this wine.",95,90.0,Oregon
66668,Argentina,"A complete Argentinean Merlot with aromas of light oak, fresh berries and spice that all come together in harmony.

66670,US,"This blend works in commingling 58% Cabernet Sauvignon, 17% Merlot, 17% Cabernet Franc and 4% each of Malbec and Petit Verdot, all from the producer's vineyard.

66671,US,"This is an exuberant, happy wine, filled with sunny summer flavors of cherries, blueberries and blackberries. The blend is based on Zinfandel and Grenache.

66672,US,"Despite coming from the warmest vintage on record for the state, this wine displays a very pleasing sense of restraint. Aromas of straw, clarified butter and peach are followed by well-balanced, textured fruit flavors. An elegant styling only heightens the appeal.",90,30.0,Washington
66673,US,"Bradley Brown's Syrah magic shines again on this wine from a vineyard planted 2,300 feet over the eastside of the Salinas Valley. The wine is redolent on the nose, with black pepper, crushed violet and salted pork. It pulls a tannic punch to the mouth once sipped, with blackberry, leather, heavy-duty tar and persistent pepper. Decant for maximum flavor extraction.",92,48.0,California

66675,Germany,"Robustly citrusy notes of orange peel and tangerine show brightly in this brisk, off-dry wine. It is approachably fresh and fruity, but nuanced by a touch of crushed stone and whiffs of rose petal on the finish. Drink now through 2018.",88,19.0,Mosel
66676,US,"Peachy Canyon NV Mustang Springs Ranch Port (Paso Robles); $40. What you need in a Port-style wine is sugary, caramelized sweetness, the deep, strong taste of fruit, high alcohol and crisp acidity. This wine has them all.

66680,US,"Deeply flavored and impressive, this intensely young, Cabernet-based Bordeaux blend hails from Mount Veeder. It has all the hallmarks of a wine that needs time in the cellar. The sweetly extracted black currant and licorice fruit is massive, and so is the cedary oak, which is 80% new French, while considerable mountain tannins give a hard, astringent mouthfeel. Solidly in the modern Napa style, this opulent wine should improve over the next six years, at least.",94,56.0,California
66681,US,"Voluptuous and savory, this Syrah is blended with 10% Viognier and the aromatics benefit as a result, a minerally mix of floral raspberry and vanilla.

66692,US,"This is a spicy, softly lush offering of Cabernet sourced from a tiny part of the Larkmead Vineyard in northern Napa Valley.

66694,France,"Vanilla and caramel flavors dominate this wine after 12 months in French oak. That means that the fruit is really not allowed to shine. It is firm, very dry and all about spice. A pepper flavor from the alcohol leaves a burn in the mouth.",83,16.0,Bordeaux

66706,US,"A little raw around the edges, lacking the sexy lushness you want in a fine Pinot Noir. Mostly that's a function of high acidity and a touch of minty green.

66707,Chile,"Jammy, slightly reduced aromas of blueberry, cassis, green herbs and mint take some getting used to.

66831,France,"Earthy notes and yeasty richness swing along the aromatic lemon bouquet. On the very slight, slender palate these flavors appear linear and leave a feeling of near weightlessness. Savory tones of yeast make themselves felt on the long, gossamer finish.",90,14.0,Alsace
66832,US,"Punchy and bright with tones of honey, pineapple and quince, this medium-sweet Riesling is an alarm clock to the senses. Juicy and forward, with a streak of sunny, lemon acidity, it's a straightforward but unabashedly satisfying quaffer.",88,17.0,New York
66833,New Zealand,"Score another for this Marlborough winery. Its SB mixes healthy doses of green pepper and snap peas with requisite citrus characteristics, and then underneath the surface there are notes of peach, melon and cream. It's a full-bodied wine, with a medium-length citrus finish and lots of texture and character. All in all it represents its homeland and the grape variety well.",90,16.0,Marlborough
66834,France,"This is a round style of wine, with its ripe apple fruits and soft texture set against a fresh, tangy backdrop. Although it is young, the wine is very drinkable now, but the fresh acidity will allow it to mature further. Best drink it from 2017.",89,27.0,Burgundy

66836,France,"From 45-year-old vines, this is a deliciously ripe wine, its firm tannins cushioned by intense berry flavors and acidity. It has all the brilliant fruit of the vintage, needing a little time to calm down and integrate with its structure. Drink from 2020.",92,120.0,Burgundy
66837,US,"Dark color and a punch of smoky oak underline this wine's big burly hold of tannin and ripe fruit. Tobacco, tar and baked cherry highlight the flavor wheel.",84,15.0,California
66838,US,"Coombsville has emerged as the hottest appellation in Napa Valley, and Cameron Hughes is right there, doing his negociant thing. The Cabernet was blended with Malbec and Merlot, and the wine is fantastically satisfying. Its rich, sturdy tannins frame elaborate blackberry, blueberry, red currant and smoky oak flavors that are wonderfully complex, with an elegant, balanced finish. This is an unbelievable price for a Cabernet of this high quality.",93,27.0,California
66839,Chile,"The ultralight color portends a light wine with pear and apple fruit, plenty of flowery sweetness and a surprisingly full, fresh finish. It's not a bad little wine, given its modest aspirations.",83,10.0,Rapel Valley
66840,US,"One of the more promising wines coming out of the newer Malibu area, this Cab that is boosted by 10% Merlot and 4% Cabernet Franc. It shows deep blueberry, black currant and black olive on the nose, along with dill, pepper, spearmint and caramel-laced fudge. The intriguing palate offers black olive, black pepper and dark, deep fruit. It's well structured and tasty, like a salt- and pepper-crusted steak.",92,30.0,California
66841,Italy,"This fresh and enjoyable wine has a bright bouquet of red berry and spice. The palate shows ripe black-cherry, nutmeg and chocolate flavors. This would pair well with pasta in meat sauce.",87,19.0,Veneto

66843,US,"Firm and spicy, this well-crafted wine has the supple fruit and steely tannic spine to evolve nicely over a decade or more. Purple berries, whiffs of moist earth, a suggestion of brioche and unexpected chocolate truffle highlights keep it interesting all through the finish.",91,50.0,Oregon
66844,Argentina,"Rubbery, spicy berry aromas are distinctly herbal. This is a high-energy Pinot with snappy flavors of citrus, pomegranate and cherry. Tomatoey acidity blended with citric notes and spice make for a gritty finish.",87,22.0,Mendoza Province
66845,US,"Here's a good buy in a big, rich, decadently delicious Syrah. Soft and dry, with refined tannins, it offers flavors of currants, blackberries, cherries, chocolate, licorice, Dr. Pepper cola, black pepper and spices. Easy to like, yet complex.",90,25.0,California
66846,France,"This taut, intense wine is a bit angular compared to many Tavels, but pull out a bottle around Thanksgiving, and it should be singing. Cherry and citrus flavors collide on the palate, but should merge into a seamless whole with a bit of bottle age.",90,16.0,Rhône Valley
66847,US,"Brilliant pink with a touch of orange, this refreshing and light-bodied wine tastes fresh and strawberrylike. It has an appetizingly crisp texture and clean fruity finish.",90,28.0,California
66848,US,"Merlot has long been a particular strength at Forgeron. Up front in this new release is a thick vein of chocolate around rich black cherry fruit. The wine dips a bit in midpalate, then re-emerges in a finish with chewy tannins and citrusy acidity. The odds strongly favor more improvement with further bottle age; try after 2016.",92,30.0,Washington
66849,New Zealand,"The style at Martinborough Vineyards has always been geared toward aging, and this 2011 is still remarkably fresh. Floral and cherry notes lead the way, backed by tart acids and firm tannins. Worth stashing away until 2018.",90,90.0,Martinborough
66850,US,"Fragrant, with scents and flavors of pears and orange blossoms. This wine has 1.8% residual sugar, which qualifies it as off-dry, but it is still quite suitable for a wide range of foods, especially spicy Asian dishes. Full, fleshy and well-made, it delivers plenty of fresh fruit flavor with enough spice and acid to give a lift to the finish.",88,10.0,Washington
66851,US,"Heavy and full-bodied, a dense, soft Pinot Noir that seems too ripe for comfort. The cherry and currant flavors veer into raisins. The vineyard is from the warmest part of Russian River Valley, almost into Dry Creek Valley.",85,42.0,California
66852,US,"Classic Howell Mountain Cabernet. The fruit is intense and concentrated in black currants and cocoa, the tannins are strong and hard, the acidity is perfect, the finish is entirely dry, and there's a firm minerality. So deliciously elegant now, it's hard to resist, but this Cab will surely reward cellaring through at least 2017.",93,75.0,California
66853,Italy,"Aromas of cream caramel, baked plum, vanilla and coffee carry over to the palate along with prune and toast. It ends quickly on a note of raspy, astringent tannins that leave the mouth feeling dry. Superior Wines, Wine Warehouse.",87,90.0,Veneto

66855,Italy,"Mostly Cabernet with 305 Sangiovese, Camartina is a thick, solid, streamlined wine that shows the highest level of winemaking expertise.

66858,US,"This Bordeaux blend has a surprisingly broad aspect, with very young fruit that opens up and then sits on the midpalate. It's much more open and expressive than the last few vintages. At first it seems dumbed down on the finish, but it slowly opens, and retasted on the second day it has filled out with muscle and verve.",91,44.0,Washington
66859,US,"This wine, from veteran winemaker Steve Dooley, shows an herbal side on the nose, with charred pine prominent, alongside licorice and dried strawberries. The palate combines cranberry and pomegranate with healthy amounts of sage.",92,38.0,California
66860,US,"Brisk in acidity, this Riesling is absolutely dry, although it offers a sunburst of ripe apples, Meyer lemons and spices. There's a touch of that telltale diesel fuel for interest. With low (13.4%) alcohol, it's easy to drink. Fine now with halibut, trout, or with a simple but elegant grilled chicken.",87,18.0,California
66861,France,"This is a ripe, creamy wine with fresh currant and ripe peach fruits. It is lightly tangy, although its main strength is the refreshing fruitiness. Bright and crisp at the end, it is ready to drink.",88,25.0,Loire Valley
66862,New Zealand,"This is the rare Riesling that has seen some oak influence. Yet it's not obtrusive at all, and just adds hints of honey, vanilla and toast to the wine's already complex flavors, encompassing lilac blossoms, fresh greens, peach and tangerine. It's on the full-bodied side of the Riesling spectrum, with just a pinch of residual sugar and a pleasant cremainess on the midpalate.",90,25.0,Marlborough
66863,US,"This is dry and crisp in acidity, with suggestions of oranges and buttered toast that wash out in the finish.",82,18.0,California
66864,US,"This barrel-fermented, estate-grown wine matches its luscious citrus and pineapple fruit to veins of butter, caramel and toast. It's perfectly balanced, lively and fresh, even after being open for a full 24 hours. The style, now becoming particular to many Oregon Chardonnays, sits squarely on the fence between the hyper-lushness of California and the minerality of northern Burgundies.",92,50.0,Oregon
66865,US,"Quite tannic and oaky, this rough and chewy Merlot is constructed around a thin layer of cassis fruit. But the big flavors are the dark, earthy ones—raw wood and thick tannin.",85,19.0,Oregon
66866,US,"The extra time has helped to unwrap what must have been an exceedingly compact wine, but it still needs to be decanted and/or cellared further. The black fruits are subservient to the dense, tarry tannins. Everything is ripe, but ripe as fine Bordeaux is ripe, with earth and bark and herb still prominent.",91,50.0,Washington
66867,France,"“Close to the stars” is the motto of this Dubois family's wine, which is soft and fruity. A peppery edge from Mourvèdre in the blend contrasts with the attractive acidity and red fruit in the background. It is a food style of rosé.",86,16.0,Provence
66868,US,"Very dry and tannic, an austere young Cabernet that offering much relief now. You'll find a very rich, concentrated core of blackberries and minerals, brightened by a scour of fine, clean acidity. The odds are heavily in favor of this wine aging well for a decade.",93,110.0,California
66869,France,"Using grapes sourced from a steep slope in the Blanchot Vineyard, this powerful wine shows richness as well as concentrated fruitiness. Its smooth, mineral texture is punctuated acidity and flavors of apricot and melon fruit. Age for 4–5 years.",93,,Burgundy

66872,US,"This wine doesn't skimp on barrel flavors or overall richness, even in this cool vintage. Oily, nutty and fragrant, with a scintillating mix of ripe yellow fruits and sweet toast, this viscous, generous wine is drinking beautifully and may be enjoyed immediately.",94,80.0,Oregon
66873,US,"More oak than the wine can handle is what you get here, from the woody, buttery overtoasted nose through the soft, clumsy, creamy body.  It's a real challenge to find any fruit, so you had better like a fully wooded wine if you're going to take a crack at this one.",85,16.0,California
66874,South Africa,"Earthy scents of feneel and pepper lead this distinctive Merlot from Thorntree. Young but accessible, the wine offers an appealing blend of berry, spice and dried herbs on the palate. Coluild benefit from some aging, but will pair well with duck and grilled meats.",86,9.0,Western Cape
66875,Spain,"Given the limited sampling of what I've tried from Casa l'Angel, this is a winery to watch.

It's solidly built, ready to drink and offers satisfying flavors of cherry and blackberry in front of a warm, medicinal finish.",89,15.0,Levante
66876,France,"The second wine of Château Dassault in Saint-Émilion is rich and fruity, bringing out the ripe fruit of the vintage. The tannins, already well integrated, give the wine a firm core that is surrounded by juicy blackberry flavors and final acidity. Developing well, the wine should be ready from 2018.",90,40.0,Bordeaux
66877,France,"Beyond the hard edge of tannins, this is an extracted wine, with dark chocolate and wood flavors. The hints of fruit bring out a more gentle black currant ripeness, although they are far from developing well.",88,,Bordeaux
66878,US,"Too ripe and obvious in fruit, with raisin, currant and black cherry jam flavors, accented with smoky, caramelized oak. Good and rich, but lacks subtlety. Drink now.",84,28.0,California
66879,US,"A vibrantly fruity wine, with lemon, lime, pineapple and grapefruit flavors brightened with zesty acidity. It's basically dryish to off-dry, with a touch of honey on the finish. Good price for an easy cocktail sipper.",85,11.0,California
66880,US,"A big wine, saturated in color and tremendously extracted in fruity richness. Explodes in blackberries, cassis and sweet new oak, and the tannins are strong and refined. Not particularly drinkable now, because the parts are only clumsily melded, but seems like a serious cellar candidate. Should begin to blossom in 6–8 years and, given this wine's history, will be rocking by 2020.",93,250.0,California
66881,US,"Quite watery, the nose shows just a touch of gunmetal, pear flesh and apple blossom. The palate is a bit flat, with steel and apple elements.",83,14.0,California
66882,US,"Black cherry and black currant open the nose on this bottling, but there are more savory components of soy and black pepper lurking in the background. The palate is lively with black raspberry before the chalky, still quite stiff tannins arise, carrying flashes of cigar box, pencil shavings and bittersweet chocolate.",90,34.0,California
66883,US,"A rich, creamy wine, loaded with personality. Spicy, oaky aromas ride over tropical fruit and peach scents, and it drinks crisp and spicy, although the midpalate is a little thin in fruit. The oaky sweetness is very nice, and so is the whistle-clean finish.",87,22.0,California
66884,US,"Baked strawberries, peppercorns and lavender flowers converge for a dynamic nose on this bottling, which also offers scents of sea-salt caramel and toasted oak. There's lots of vibrancy to the sip, where beef char, oregano, marjoram and thyme give nuance to the full-bodied, black pepper-laced blackberry jam.",92,29.0,California
66885,US,"Alone among a lineup of pure single-varietal reds, this reserve-level Meritage blend shows ample fruit, with juicy citrus and sour-cherry flavors. The blend is 75% Cabernet Sauvignon, filled out with Cab Franc, Merlot and Malbec. Chalky acids dominate a short finish.",87,60.0,Oregon
66886,US,"Smoked raspberry, mulberry, rust, slate and a bright hibiscus touch show on the nose of this appellation blend, which tends to be more widely available than the winery's single-vineyard expressions. Cranberry fruit meets with rocky minerality on the palate, as wild herbs add to the complexity.",89,48.0,California
66887,Germany,"While demure on the nose with faint hints of blossom and mineral, the palate of this sprightly kabinett surges with ripe yellow cherry and peach flavors. It's a finely filigreed yet unctuously juicy sip. Drink now through 2020.",90,13.0,Mosel

66890,US,"Delicious aromas of black raspberries, frozen strawberries and cola season a slight bit of gamy character on this wine that master sommelier Paolo Barbieri makes in Los Olivos with Syrah star Joey Tensley.

66891,US,"Winemaker Gustavo Gonzalez left Robert Mondavi to do his own thing, and what an auspicious start. He's taken fruit from this historic Carneros vineyard and crafted a big and bold yet balanced Pinot filled with lusciousness. The flavors are enormously complex, ranging from fresh raspberry jam and cranberries to red currants and persimmons. Earthy cola, mushroom and forest floor notes add complexity. The acid-tannin balance is just about perfect. Good as it is, this compelling Pinot should develop well over the next six years.",94,42.0,California
66892,US,"Very rich and ripe, marked by pure, intense flavors of cherries, blueberries and spicy cloves. It displays the balanced elegance and thoughtful winemaking of this winery. Young and juicy now, it should develop in the bottle for a year or two, but some sharpness in the finish will ultimately limit ageability.",90,35.0,California
66893,France,"This Premier Cru vineyard lies north of the Grand Crus, with a west-facing exposure. It has yielded a wine with soft, generous floral character, ripe yellow fruit and a crisp, mineral edge. Finely sculpted and ageworthy, it will be best from 2019.",93,40.0,Burgundy
66894,US,"York Mountain actually predates Paso Robles as an appellation, so it's great to see Neil Collins making such excellent wine from its nearly forgotten western slopes.

66896,US,"Big and bold, broad in texture and deep in ripe, chocolaty flavors, this wine is full bodied. Rich in mouthfeel, it's almost sweet, and deftly made to be appealing now despite very firm tannins. It will be outstanding in a pairing with big proteins.",91,45.0,California
66897,US,"This wine from the historic vineyard offers classic oaky aromas of smoke, butterscotch and salty roasted nuts. Smokiness lingers throughout the soft, excellently weighted palate that surrounds rich apple, nectarine and white peach flesh, with a citrus pith tension holding it together.",91,40.0,California
66898,Spain,"Cotton candy and apple cider aromas give way to a mild palate with soft acidity but a sense of complexity. Plump red-fruit flavors are not specific, and overall this blend of Tempranillo, Syrah and Garnacha is appealing but slightly vacuous.",86,30.0,Central Spain
66899,US,"Roasted plum, smoke and a hint of licorice emerge from this lightly styled blend of 38% Grenache, 37% Tempranillo and 25% Mourvèdre.

66900,US,"This Bordeaux-style blend is 42% Cabernet Sauvignon, 24% Merlot, and 34% Cabernet Franc. Some 20% saw new French oak, and the wine has lovely concentration and flavor integration.

66901,US,"Pure Cabernet Sauvignon, deep and sappy, with the dark, licorice and coffee-infused complexity of Walla Walla's best bottles. Sharp and young, with a potent, liquorous finish, this explosive bottle of cassis-driven fruit should cellar well for a decade or more.",93,53.0,Washington
66902,US,"Just 10% of this wine was fermented in new French oak which adds a bit of weight and length. Grapefruit, peach and lime mingle on the palate, a briny afterthought providing an edge. Smooth and refreshing, it ends in a long dream of lemon.",92,20.0,California
66903,US,"This wine is 100% varietal coming from one of the top vineyards in the state. Reserved aromas of spice box, blackberry, barrel tones and gun smoke lead to elegantly styled fruit flavors. There are some interesting thing going on but they don't all come together at present.",88,65.0,Washington

66907,South Africa,"Winemaker: Coenie Snyman. Deep, almost liquorous aromas of cassis, black cherry and raspberry sauce lead the nose of this concentrated wine. A blend of 60% Cabernet Sauvignon, 30% Syrah, 5% Merlot and 5% Petit Verdot, the ripe, lush palate offers ample tannic structure, but is lifted by vibrant acidity and a fruity juiciness that carries through to the finish. Hints of bittersweet chocolate and licorice root unfold on the back on the close. It's approachable now, and should continue to age well through 2022.",91,,Stellenbosch
66908,Germany,"Plump, mouthfilling and sweet, this is an easy-to-appreciate auslese loaded with fruit-driven flavor. Honeyed apples and pear lead the way, garnished by touches of stone fruit, orange marmalade and hints of slaty minerality. There's a slightly bitter tinge to the finish, but it actually helps the wine's overall balance.",90,40.0,Mosel-Saar-Ruwer
66909,US,"This estate red is named after its mountainous locale—a brambly vineyard on Pritchard Hill above Oakville. It combines quite ripe Cabernet Sauvignon with 15% Cabernet Franc, 15% Petit Verdot and 5% Merlot, projecting power and prestige with perfumed violet, dark cherry and savory leather and tobacco notes. Soft, pliable tannins add weight and texture. More time in bottle should add nuance; enjoy 2024–2034.",93,225.0,California
66910,Chile,"Crisp plum and berry aromas are solid and clean. This feels tight, fresh and well built.

66916,Austria,"There is a citrus purity on the nose that suggests fresh lemon juice, but it is tempered by some spice, like that of still-green Seville orange rind.

A very fine value, it can also age for a decade or longer.",92,19.0,Oregon
66924,US,"One of several Rieslings from this producer, this low-alcohol effort has some residual sugar, though not enough to seem off-dry. It displays peach and melon fruit, with hints of rock candy. Fermented in stainless steel with native yeast, it's a fine all-purpose white.",88,20.0,Oregon

66934,France,"88—90 Barrel sample. A wine with a high wood content, maybe too much – the question is over the fruit's ability to stand up to the blast of wood. The result is a wine that is super-spicy.",89,,Bordeaux
66935,US,"This wine aims to call attention to the tendency of Clone 17 (also known as the Robert Young clone) to provide baked apple and ripe, almond flavors and aromas, which this bottling does, in spades.

66947,New Zealand,"A little shy at first, and smelling slightly synthetic, this wine needs a little time in glass. Eventually it opens to reveal notes of cherry cola and coffee spice.

66995,France,"This is an immensely dense wine that is going to be a classic. The dark tannins are still lined with wood aging but that will go because the fruit underneath is also just as dense and intense. Blackberry, black plum and damson plum give power and sweetness. This is a great wine with huge potential. Drink from 2028.",97,145.0,Bordeaux
66996,Spain,"Loamy aromas of wet clay and blackberry transition to gamy and animal-like with airing. This blend of Monastrell, Syrah and Cabernet Sauvignon feels full and rough, with hard tannins.

67043,US,"This forward, fruity Cabernet Sauvignon is plummy and ripe with notes of black cherry preserves and cassis liqueur. It's plush on the palate, with soft, sunny acidity, but moderate alcohol keeps it fresh and quaffable.",86,23.0,New York
67044,US,"From the new Happy Canyon appellation, this wine is so close to being so good. It's dry and rich in acidity, and complex in blackberry, cherry and currant flavors that finish long and sweet. This new 7200 line from Foxen is worth watching over future vintages.",89,35.0,California
67045,Israel,"A delicious Cabernet loaded with black currant and plum complemented by hints of pepper and mocha. The medium body and appropriately gripping tannins give way to a solid, lingering finish, making this a suitable companion to most meat and game dishes.",86,47.0,Judean Hills
67046,US,"The 2010 Jammin' Red is an ambitious blend of Merlot, Cabernet Sauvignon, Malbec, Cab Franc and a bit of Tempranillo. Sweet cherry fruit is the focus, leaving a trail of pretty, hard candy flavor as it rolls across the tongue. The tannins are astringent, a bit chalky, and the finish does a quick fade.",87,20.0,Washington

67049,US,"A peachy, fruit-forward, mouthfilling wine that brings bright Washington fruit—peaches, apples and pears—into play, along with caramel candy and underlying acid support. It falls short only in the finish, which turns slightly bitter and attenuated.",87,18.0,Washington
67050,US,"Easily as good as Chardonnays costing two or three times as much, this is a great value, and with production at 12,000 cases, it should be fairly easy to find. It's rich in orange, apricot and buttered toast flavors, with balancing acidity and a dry finish.",88,13.0,California
67051,France,"At first taste, this wine seems more new world than Bordeaux. But then the subtle, perfumed aromas and structured fruit show through, along with the clean acidity and black tannic fruits. Give this wine at least 12 years before opening.",94,80.0,Bordeaux

67053,US,"Delicious and classy, this is based on Merlot, with the other four classic Bordeaux varieties in proper proportion.

Drink now and over the next six years.",93,55.0,California
67054,US,"Anywhere but in Oregon, this could be labeled Pinot Noir, which makes up 80% of the blend; the rest is Zinfandel. It's a combination that makes sense in the Columbia Gorge. The Pinot is more earthy and tannic than in the Willamette Valley, and the Zin lighter than you find in California. The result is a wine tasting of wild cherries, tart, spicy and quite quaffable.",87,24.0,Oregon
67055,US,"With fruit from the Hames Valley AVA, this Morgan Hill-based winery delivers distinct aromas of pomegranate-glazed mushrooms and red pepper spice.

67057,US,"An outstanding wine, the best California Cabernet Jean-Charles Boisset has ever produced from any of his properties. It stands out in any tasting of its peers. Made from 100% Cabernet Sauvignon, and aged in 60% new oak, it shows satisfying, complex flavors of blackberries, blueberries, cassis, hazelnut-infused chocolate and spices. Hard to exaggerate its power and grace. Wonderful now and for a good six years, but it's difficult to predict its evolution beyond 2018.",97,150.0,California
67058,US,"This 100% Cabernet Sauvignon has massive waves of blackberry, black currant and chocolate flavors that take over the palate, plus a sweet note of toast from the oak.

67067,Chile,"If this isn't Chile's best Syrah, then it's among the top three. Graphite, tobacco, leather, blackberry, baked black plum and spice aromas set up a lively palate, with firm tannins and good acidity.

67070,US,"This brand reliably produces varietally correct, down-the-middle wines, and this is no exception, starting with aromas of Anjou pear, underripe honeydew, tight white-flower buds and freshly cut key lime. The ripe stone-fruit flavors on the sip are cut by citrus and wet cement, offering all the elements to please many a Sauv Blanc fan.",88,12.0,California
67071,France,"There are strong elements of the wood aging in this structured wine. That gives it a dry character that still dominates the red fruits. It needs to develop. While it will always have a dry character, look for the fruit to shine with its berry flavors and acidity. Wait to drink until 2018.",88,17.0,Bordeaux
67072,US,"For a Chardonnay, the aromas of slate and petrol are a bit odd, but nonetheless idiosyncratic. Touches of white flower and wood smoke add further dimension.

67089,US,"This new Bordeaux-style red could technically be labeled Cabernet Sauvignon, as it accounts for 82% of the blend. Pungently smoky, the impression of charred wood penetrates into the deep core of cassis and black cherry. Dark and quite tannic, it remains to be seen if all that barrel toast will ultimately meld into the rest of the wine.",88,65.0,Washington

67094,US,"This Merlot-dominated blend is sourced exclusively from the Stillwater Creek Vineyard. The entry-level red blend from Baer, it's a broad, spicy, somewhat peppery wine, reflecting the cooler vintage and northern site. The listed alcohol does not show in the palate, which tilts a little toward the green side, and falls away rather quickly.",86,29.0,Washington
67095,Argentina,"Everything about this Tempranillo-led blend rings true. It's full and flush on the nose, with clean berry and snappy tomato and spice notes.

67097,Chile,"Dark, dense and very modern in style, with captivating aromas and obvious richness. At 14.5%, this is big, New World Pinot Noir.

With a cool finish, steady acidity and tannins, and fine purity, Alazan ranks as one of South America's few top-tier Pinot Noirs.",90,30.0,Casablanca Valley
67098,Germany,"This is immensely promising, offering scents of slate, slightly leesy notes, white peach and pineapple. But on the palate, the flavors aren't quite as fresh, changing over to dried pineapple and golden raisin, and while the mouthfeel is rich and sweet upfront, the wine seems to dry up a bit on the finish, where it shows a touch of bitterness. Probably best to drink it young.",88,24.0,Mosel-Saar-Ruwer

It's tasty, though relatively simple, especially for fruit from this vineyard, which is known for its earthy terroir.",88,25.0,Oregon

67111,US,"At 62,000-plus cases, you are in the land of the seamless blend. Oregon does not have vast contiguous vineyards, so these grapes must have come from here, there and everywhere.

67114,US,"This is a big, voluptuous Pinot, solidly in the Garys' style, but it possesses a delicate silkiness despite the size. In its extreme youth, the wine is all primary fruit and oak, with flavors of cherries, black raspberries, red licorice, cola and smoky vanilla. It feels broad and obvious, in the way of a young wine. However, 1-3 years in the bottle should bring out complexity.",91,48.0,California

67147,Spain,"Distant berry, plum and earthy aromas come in front of a choppy, tight palate with depth. Plum, tomato and herbal flavors finish with good structure. Overall, this La Mancha Cabernet Sauvignon is well knit, without any notable faults. Drink through 2021.",90,28.0,Central Spain
67148,France,This wine comes from one of Côtes de Provence historic cru classé estates. It is a ripe and smooth wine with crisp acidity and a fine bite of spice. The wine is packed with red fruits and finished with refreshing acidity.,88,20.0,Provence
67149,France,"Classic Lynch-Bages with just a bit of extra power and richness. While the tannins are structured, it is the velvety fruit that rolls around the mouth that is the most dominant character. It is coming together into a wine that will be big and dense, but never over the top.",96,115.0,Bordeaux
67150,New Zealand,"This is on the ripe side of the Sauvignon spectrum, with scents of honey and marmalade on the nose and flavors of ripe citrus, touches of stone fruit and hints of currant on the palate. It's simply fruit-driven, but satisfying nonetheless. Drink now.",87,14.0,Marlborough
67151,US,"This boasts appealing tropical fruit flavors that have been generously oaked. The honey quality lends smoothness and a round mellowness, and the finish is quite dry. It shows a softness some may fault, but this is ultimately delicious, and it will be a great accompaniment to rich shellfish.",90,28.0,California
67152,Chile,"Prickly and varietally correct on the nose, this opens with grassy aromas and a pop of citrus. A standard mouthfeel with adequate acidity projects salty citrus and green flavors, while grapefruit pith and lime notes work the finish.",85,8.0,Central Valley
67153,US,This light-bodied wine has aromas of celery and citrus that lead to crisp flavors of fresh herbs and lemon. Good acidity is smoothed out by a hint of sweetness lending a soft effect to the midpalate and finish.,85,8.0,California

67155,US,"Pretty pricey, but it's a lovely Pinot Noir. Offers lots of upfront raspberry and cherry tart flavors, with a jacket of sweet, smoky oak. The mouthfeel is nice and light. Drink up.",88,60.0,California
67156,US,"The blend is all over the map, with portions of Merlot, Syrah, Cabernet, Petit Verdot and Malbec. There's a whiff of leather and a core of sweet plum, with lean, slightly stemmy tannins.",86,22.0,Washington
67157,US,"This nonvintage rosé, modeled after a Bandol, is a blend of grapes and vintages, yet retains superb freshness and offers unusual complexity. Rich and tart, with a creamy strawberry core, it also shows sandalwood highlights and a hint of barrel toast.",91,35.0,Oregon
67158,France,"Heavy extraction has given the wine a dark, bitter-chocolate character along with a serious amount of toast flavors. The result is a wine that is tough and only hinting at the fruit. It will probably soften as it develops although that firm wood character will likely remain. Drink from 2018.",86,26.0,Bordeaux
67159,South Africa,"Earthy tobacco, smoke and spice on the nose and a fruit-forward palate make this expressive Shiraz an attractive cohort to smoked meat dishes and cheese assortments. The wine has a backbone of toasted oak and a smooth character.",85,27.0,Stellenbosch
67160,US,"This bottling is quintessential Red Mountain in style, with potent aromatics of concentrated black fruits, gun metal and rock. Sourced from Ciel du Cheval, Obelisco, Force Majeure and Klipsun, it's a one-wine showcase for the AVA. The spectrum of fruit flavors is impressive, compact and deep, and despite the high alcohol it retains its precision and detail.",96,85.0,Washington
67161,US,"Dense, intense, concentrated and young, this wine is one for the cellar. It has tight aromas of cranberry, dried cherry and cardamom, while flavors offer ripe fruit character and a firm texture of fine-grained tannins. It should gain more complexity and smoothness after 2022.",94,95.0,California
67162,US,"Merits its high score by virtue of the concentrated black currant flavors that are so intense and pure, they're the essence of Cabernet Sauvignon. Yet the wine is also very tannic, with a lockdown astringency that leaves the mouth all puckery after you swallow. Give it 5–6 years in a good cellar.",90,40.0,California
67163,US,"Quite dark, smoky and well along the path to full maturity, the fruit in this single-vineyard Cab is initially overshadowed completely by scents of charred wood. The soft cherry fruit seems wrapped—indeed soaked—in barrel flavors. With substantial breathing time, the fruit comes up and the tannins subside, at least enough to accompany a grilled steak or burger.",87,53.0,Oregon
67164,Chile,"Well roasted and toasty, with plenty of barrel power and underlying black berry fruit. The palate is tight and fully tannic, while the palate has plum and sweet berry flavors. Ripe, a little grating and uncomplicated.",87,17.0,Colchagua Valley

67167,Germany,"Kesseler's gems are the GG wines, but this is a medium-bodied, cleanly made introduction to the estate. Petrol, apple and wet stone notes are pretty standard Riesling fare, rendered in a crisp, refreshing style.",86,28.0,Rheingau
67168,Australia,"Its pale-gold color gives this rich, oaky style away. Lemon, green papaya, mint, nuts and wet stone all mingle with tongue-tingling acidity. The palate is on the lean and mean side at the moment, and the oak sticks out too, but there's a redeeming smokey, mineral finish and the hope that all will settle with time. Drink now–2025.",89,25.0,Western Australia
67169,Italy,"A red blend from Salento, this bright red offers jammy notes of blackberry preserves, black cherry and prune. There's an impression of sweetness on the finish, followed by a rich, chewy mouthfeel.",87,12.0,Southern Italy
67170,Italy,"Here's a concentrated Valpolicella that opens with aromas of new leather, truffle, French oak and a balsamic note. The firm palate shows raisin, fig and oak-driven spice alongside close-grained tannins. Drink soon to capture the remaining fruit and freshness.",87,21.0,Veneto
67171,France,"One of the many chateaus with vines on the wide valley floor of the Dordogne, this estate has made a lightly extracted wine that has chocolate as well as blackberry stalkiness.

67172,US,"This blend of Tempranillo, Malbec, Dolcetto, Merlot and Syrah could have turned into a generic red, yet it is seamless and nicely proportioned. It's a real crowd-pleaser, with a ripe red-fruit flavor and generous new-barrel-derived toast and spice notes.",90,15.0,Oregon
67173,US,"The aromas of cocoa, vanilla, coconut and dried herbs are still quite locked up, with the oak out front. The cherry flavors are dense, plush and layered, with vanilla and other barrel spices speckled throughout. It provides plenty of immediate appeal but will only benefit from some time in the cellar; best after 2019.",93,65.0,Washington
67174,France,"94–96. Barrel sample. Big and rich with lots of chocolate and ripe black-plum fruits, this is a very structured wine, showing some extraction but also spice and sweet tannins. Powerful, but with a finish that is like a cool breeze.",95,,Bordeaux

67176,US,"This wine is one of Galante's better efforts over the years, with fine acidity and a silky texture providing a framework for raspberry and cherry flavors. It's a straightforward, simple wine for drinking right away.",86,30.0,California
67177,France,"This is a limited production wine from small parcels of limestone soil. Aged in acacia barrels, it has subtle spice and toast flavors. They wood aging has had the effect of broadening the wine and giving it extra richness. It's an impressive wine, ready to drink from 2018.",94,39.0,Loire Valley
67178,France,"There is a hint of flinty reduction that still clings to the nose. Underneath that is shy crisp red-cherry fruit. The palate adds glimpses of lifted conifer aromas to that. There is lightness and a very fine structure, but also depth. This is very elegant and understated but all the more touching for that. The finish is totally refreshing and dry.",91,34.0,Alsace

67180,US,"This reserve-level wine is annotated with interesting highlights of iron, mint and tea leaf, all wrapped around a black-cherry core. There's a streak of cola running through it all, and just a hint of alcohol burn in the finish.",88,48.0,Oregon
67181,US,"This wine, from one of the coolest parts of the Russian River Valley, has hints of the mushroomy earthiness that plagues some 2011 Pinot Noirs. But for whatever reason (good viticulture and careful sorting are likely), that slight unripeness remains only in the background as a complex counter to the tart cranberries, cherries and cola. The wine is marked by dryness and bright acidity. Surely it wants some time in the bottle. Drink after 2017.",91,60.0,California
67182,US,"A marvelous effort in a difficult year, this textbook Washington Riesling is bursting with apricot and peach goodness. Round and polished, it's long and textured, with an excellent wash of minerality.",91,9.0,Washington
67183,Chile,"A glassy, crisp style of SB from Bío Bío in Chile's south. The nose is pungent and slick, while the palate has a smooth, tangy set of green fruit flavors like lime and apple. Reserved on the finish, with chiseled acids and fresh simplicity.",87,9.0,Bío Bío Valley
67184,Israel,"Dark garnet in the glass, this wine has a bouquet of black cherry, vanilla and anise. Flavors of black cherry, raspberry, chocolate and violet roll on the tongue amidst almost chewy tannins that are kept in check by bright acidity. There is a strong note of cranberry on the finish and a touch of chocolate on the post-palate.",89,12.0,Negev
67185,US,"Way too oaky. Compromised by the clumsy, heavy application of wood. The caramel and roasted butterscotch aromas and flavors completely swamp whatever wine lies beneath.",82,45.0,California
67186,France,"Full of the fresh acidity of the 2014 vintage, this light, bright wine has refreshing lemon and crisp apple flavors that are given richness by the lively acidity. Bursting with fruit, it is ready to drink now.",87,25.0,Burgundy
67187,US,"Though labeled Syrah, this includes 25% Cabernet Sauvignon in the blend. The addition somewhat mutes the Syrah character, though it may bump up the concentration of cassis fruit flavor. Espresso-laden tannins put a frame around the finish.",87,28.0,Washington
67188,Chile,"Big, dark, earthy and rubbery, with hefty black fruit on the nose and palate. A generous wine with toasty blackberry, cassis and a sprinkle of chocolate, and then a smooth finish. Among value-priced wines from anywhere in the world this is more than one should expect. It's really a nice Cab.",88,9.0,Curicó Valley
67189,France,"Aux Echanges is one of the smallest Premier Crus in Chambolle on the northern end close to Morey Saint-Denis, an area that gives a firm character to the wine. The structure is all there with some solid tannins although the wine also has superripe red fruits that are delicious and jammy. Full in the mouth, it is still young, so drink from 2019.",94,125.0,Burgundy
67190,France,Some smoke and crushed boysenberry play on nose and palate. The pleasant smokiness reaches into all corners of this soft but fresh wine. It has a lovely rounded balance despite the relatively light body where earthiness is as present as fruit.,89,30.0,Alsace
67191,US,"This is a robust, brawny wine, exuberant in wild strawberry and earthy black pepper and black tea.

67194,Italy,"Aromas of black currant and a whiff of bell pepper slowly emerge on this hearty blend of 65% Cabernet Sauvignon, 25% Merlot and 10% Cabernet Franc.

67195,France,"This fine, ageworthy wine is rounded, smooth and full of ripe yellow fruit. There is a zesty tang on the back palate that will allow it to mature, its richness shining through a frame of crisp texture. Drink from 2020.",92,53.0,Burgundy

67197,Germany,"This wine comes out of the bottle a little cranky, but give it some time in the glass and the initial stink gives way to notes of lime, apple and peach. It's plump in feel, with some dusty minerality and dried spices adding nuance to the sweet fruit.",90,18.0,Mosel-Saar-Ruwer
67198,US,"There are very savory aromas on this wine, with campfire smoke and herb-crusted game dominating the boysenberry fruit in the background. The tannins are edgy, and toasted oak flavors persist in a pleasant way, with black cherry and licorice present as well.",88,65.0,California

67201,US,"Elegant in construction, with fine acidity and a sleek mouthfeel. What really stars are the flavors. Massive in raspberry and cherry pie filling, cola and pomegranates, with lots of peppery spices and a smoky oak envelope. Should develop bottle complexity over the next six years.",93,70.0,California

67207,US,"Savory pepper and rustic gravel aromas meet with strawberry and dried cherry on the nose of this proprietary red blend that is widely available. Strawberry pie flavors dominate the sip, but there's also a lava rock minerality and a burst of acidity.",88,15.0,California
67208,France,"A tight and closed wine from the southernmost premier cru, this is still developing. As it fills out, it will bring in the apple ripeness and fresh character that are just a hint at the moment. It will certainly remain structured and nervy with a strongly steely aftertaste. Drink from 2018.",93,,Burgundy
67209,US,"This fleshy, tropical wine offers a wealth of rich peach, pineapple and golden honey flavor in a medium-bodied frame. It finishes light and bright, with an undercurrent of toasted oak.",90,30.0,California
67210,US,"Right out of the chute this toasty, dark, dense, sexy wine says, “Drink me!” But some further time in bottle seems like the better plan. It's quite young, tight, still a bit awkward in the mouth, with the barrel and fruit flavors not quite integrated.

Just let it all settle down before you pop the (glass) cork.",91,48.0,Oregon

67212,US,"Pure Syrah from the Boushey Vineyard, this was barrel aged in a mix of half new Russian and French oak.

May be cellared for up to a decade.",92,65.0,Oregon
67220,US,"Superb, opulent, just wonderful. Hard to exaggerate the beauty of this 100% Cabernet Sauvignon. Fantastically ripe and rich in black cherries, currants, sandalwood and spices, with a grounding streak of herbs. Beyond the flavors is the near-perfect structure, marked by smooth, complex tannins.

67223,US,"Though Adelsheim offers a large assortment of single-vineyard Pinots, this is the first they've made from Zenith. It surely won't be the last. Concentrated, thick black raspberry and black cherry fruit centers a substantial wine, laced with vivid streaks of vanilla, tobacco and spice. The immediate impact of the fruit is amplified by the density on the palate, and the finish, loaded with baking spices, reflects the aging in one-third new French oak barrels.",93,90.0,Oregon

67239,US,"Sourced from near the town of Sebastopol, in a site rich in Goldridge soils, this wine is juicy and complex, founded on a core of orange and cherry, with a tang of acidity that competes with the lushness. A brushy forest-floor note lies underneath the fruit, providing a lovely, savory counterpoint to the succulence.",94,60.0,California

67249,France,"This wine is lean, austere with high acidity that leaves fruit well behind. It is structured and dry, only hinting at black-currant freshness. This third-generation family estate also hosts monthly musical and tasting events and sells fruit, vegetables and honey.",84,32.0,Bordeaux

67255,US,"Medium in weight and structure, this wine shows a tempting leanness at first, balancing its ripeness with complex notions of clove, cola and black cherry. Twisted in tannin and oak on the midpalate, its youthfulness on full display, it has a succulent finish.",92,175.0,California

67285,US,"The winery held this Chardonnay back a year later than their far more expensive Journey bottling. Hard to say why, but the consumer is the beneficiary.

67310,France,"This is a smoky, wood-aged wine, with a bitter toast flavor that smothers the fruit. It does have the fruit weight, so that toast flavor will certainly soften. But to judge by the intense wood character, this bottling will likely always have a severe edge.",85,20.0,Bordeaux
67311,Chile,"Sharp and almost vinegar-like on the nose, with a strong blast of field greens and nettle. The palate is broad and edgy, with sour plum, tarragon and juniper flavors. Very green, herbal and funky. Not one of this label's better wines.",82,12.0,Maipo Valley

67329,Argentina,"Clean and well made, but underwhelming. There's basic blueberry and blackberry flavors riding on a medium-bodied palate, but overall the wine is more generic than specific.

67330,US,"Once again the Merlot is the best of a very fine flight of Tulpen wines. More muscular than the Cabernet, it includes 10% Malbec and 5% Petit Verdot in the mix, resulting in a dense, dark wine loaded with black fruits.

67340,US,"Regrettably, this has no sweetness scale on the back label, but the 11.5% alcohol suggests that it is off-dry, as it certainly tastes.

Apple juice and honey flavors are right in the heart of this wine, which would pair well with a simple dessert of fresh fruit.",86,10.0,Washington

67342,Uruguay,"This blend of Pinot Noir and Chardonnay is orange in color and smells neutral except for a note of orange peel. On the palate, this has a grabby skins-driven texture.

67345,US,"Tastes so softly decadent, so rich in jam and chocolate flavors, that it's no surprise to learn the alcohol on this Merlot is a hefty 16.2% by volume.

67373,US,"A proportion of the grapes in this wine, accented with 2% Merlot and 1% Cabernet Franc, comes from the Lewis Vineyard, a respected site in the heart of the appellation.

67375,US,"This blend showcases the many varieties that shine at Stagecoach, from Tempranillo, which makes up 44% of the whole, to Syrah, Cabernet Franc, Sangiovese, Cabernet Sauvignon, Petit Verdot and Malbec. Floral and marked by a rocky, gravelly minerality, it tastes of cherry compote, pencil lead and black pepper, showing juicy acidity throughout. Drink now through 2023.",92,100.0,California
67376,US,"This is the only Cayuse Syrah that is co-fermented (with 8% Viognier), which adds nuances of white flower and floral, though the citrus rind scents override them. In the nose it's hugely expressive, though still quite tight and compact in the mouth; it must be decanted. It's a three ring circus of a wine, with things moving and shaking in all directions. Mineral, berry, mountain complexity, nuanced herb and earth and citrus, all in proportion, and all flowing in the mouth.",97,70.0,Washington
67377,US,"With its integrated nose of violet, spice and berry, and its balanced flavors of pepper, mocha and coffee, this wine has an ageable appeal.

The finish is intense with more of that citrus, plus an accent of ginger and lemongrass.",93,38.0,California
67380,US,"Larger than life in terms of oak and tannin on the entry, this wine is elusive in fruit. Medium-bodied, it feels weighty and sharp-shouldered, while being clearly well-made and expressive of its appellation and variety. A cherry-vanilla note rings on the finish.",88,52.0,California
67381,US,"Here's a full-bodied, deeply-flavored young Pinot that combines flamboyance with elegance, a very difficult feat for any wine. There's an exoticness to the fruits, spices and smoky, sweet oak. They all meld together into some impossibly decadent pastry, and yet the finish is firm and dry. Should evolve through 2012, at least.",94,60.0,California
67382,US,"Tropical and fleshy with upfront acidity, this wine has a full-bodied richness on the nose and overtone, despite a more light-bodied midpalate and finish. Along the way, lemony brightness mingles with a taste of yellow apple.",88,18.0,California
67383,Italy,"Here's a super Tuscan that's made for food, not fireside sipping. It's full of red fruit, mostly currants and plum. There's a menthol/eucalyptus element in there as well.

Tannins are polished and the flavors linger delightfully.",92,35.0,Oregon

67394,Italy,"Made with equal parts Lagrein, Merlot, Syrah, Cabernet Sauvignon and Petit Verdot, this structured, balanced red boasts aromas of black pepper, black currant, toast and a whiff of bell pepper.

67398,France,"There is a touch of gold to the color of this fine, full-bodied wine that shows a light touch of sweetness. Rich lemon and honey flavors are cut with grapefruit acidity to give a taut, wonderfully crisp wine. Age for another 3–4 years.",92,48.0,Alsace
67399,US,"This new cuvée takes its name from the fermentation practice of mixing whole berries with grape-cluster stalks—just stalks, not whole clusters. Herbs and pine needle flavors dominate brambly berry fruit. It's quite young and raw, and will benefit from further bottle age.",88,50.0,Oregon

67405,US,"Young, tight and sharp, showing lots of black currant, along with pepper and spice. Maybe just a notch below the excellent 2004 L'Etalon Red.

67409,France,This is a wine with fine tannins and plenty of ripe fruit. It has good potential with fruit and structure working well together. Spice and a rich aftertaste suggest a wine that will be fine from 2018.,87,20.0,Bordeaux
67410,US,"There is an interesting floral component—white blossoms—coming through in the nose, and sailing along on top of flavors of buttered nuts. A somewhat oily mouthfeel is lifted by moderate acids, and the overall length and follow-through make this one of the better vintages of this affordably priced wine.",90,20.0,Oregon
67411,Germany,Citrus blossoms are coated in honey and peach nectar in this sunny deeply concentrated Kabinett. It's off-dry in style yet balanced by a luminous streak of tangerine acidity that drives the finish long and dry. It's a bristling revitalizing sip.,91,23.0,Mosel
67412,New Zealand,"This shows the immediate appeal of Central Otago's 2013 vintage. Yes, the acids and tannins stick out a bit, but they're cushioned by loads of ripe berry fruit. Hints of dried bracken and chocolate add complexity, while the finish glides to long, dusty completion. Drink now–2018.",92,35.0,Central Otago
67413,US,"Hot, salty popcorn, pan-fried apples and melting butter show the oak but in a judicious manner. Flavors of lemon are layered over poached apples, all presented with a mouth-enlivening acidity, and culminating with a touch of vanilla bean on the finish.",90,25.0,California
67414,US,"What a great price for a Pinot Noir with this charm and integrity. It's a wonderful wine, dry and rich in raspberry, cherry and spice flavors. Feels svelte and silky in the mouth, just like you want Pinot to be. Might even gain a few notes with a year or two in the bottle.",91,22.0,California
67415,US,"There's a cut of acidity that slices through the richness, interfering with the palate's enjoyment of this dry, silky Pinot Noir. Its flavors are of cherry tart, with the sweet, smoky crust, and a splash of cherry liqueur. Drink now.",87,75.0,California

67423,France,"Taut citrus, cleansing lemon and brisk grapefruit show an uncompromsing, dry Riesling that majors in tense citrus and wet-stone flavors. There is a linearity and a very alluring purity that deserves to develop further. This is lovely and briskly refreshing now, but time in bottle will bring out more earthy, stony complexity. Drink 2017–2025.",92,32.0,Alsace
67424,US,"You can always count on Frog's Leap to produce a dependable Merlot. This 2010 isn't their best, but it is a great wine for drinking now.

67429,US,"This wine might knock your socks off with massively rich, ripe flavors of cherry pie, blueberry jam, mocha and toasty oak, wrapped into ultra-smooth tannins. For all the richness, it's brightened with just enough acidity for balance and finishes dry. There's no reason not to drink it now. Production was only 96 cases, but it's worth a search.",92,60.0,California
67430,US,"Made from 80% Cabernet Sauvignon, with the balance Cabernet Franc and Merlot, this wine is blue-fruit dominated along with notes of high-toned herbs and chocolaty barrel spices. It's medium bodied with astringent, somewhat bitter tannins.",88,45.0,Washington

67433,US,"Tough and gritty in tannins, this Cabernet is still raw. There's a flattering core of ripe blackberry and black currant fruits, but the wine doesn't show the approachability of other 2007 Cabernets. Give it another five years in the cellar, but no guarantees that the fruit will outlast the tannins.",88,80.0,California
67434,Spain,"Flat, gritty aromas are a tad volatile. This nonvintage red feels oaky and raw, with prodding acidity. A rough mix of scouring red-berry fruit, briny notes and oak make for a marginal flavor profile, while the finish tastes briny and pickled.",83,15.0,Northern Spain

67436,Chile,"This 100% Sauvignon Blanc dessert bottling is fermented in new French oak, and is aged one year on lees. Rich honey, peach and nectarine fruit could have rendered this wine too sweet and sloppy; instead, its light, gravelly texture keeps it from being too cloying. Honey, mustard grains and light talc on the nose, and a nutty, crème brulee-like finish add elegance where, again, candy could otherwise have reigned.",90,25.0,Casablanca Valley
67437,US,"An example of a soft, accessible Pinot whose rich, ripe flavors are the main attraction. Brims with cola, cherry, cranberry and red licorice flavors. Seems best over the next 2–3 years.",88,45.0,California
67438,US,"This nontraditional blend of 50% Merlot, 25% Petite Sirah and 25% Cabernet Sauvignon works well, with fresh pressed blackberry, crushed graphite and meaty, peppercorn-crusted beef aromas. The rich mouthfeel is soft and full, with baked berry, black plum and dried ginger flavors. The acidity is powerful, almost too much so.",91,50.0,California
67439,US,"A barrel selection, the Suzanne's Reserve is more concentrated than its less expensive sibling (the Cali's Cuvée) but does not have as interesting a flavor set. Here you'll find the tangy cherry fruit is accompanied by sharp acids and chewy tannins. Although it is a 2004 the wine still seems wrapped up and refuses to let go. Give it plenty of air before drinking.",87,40.0,Oregon
67440,Italy,"This delicious Merlot and Cabernet Sauvignon blend offers an alluring fragrance of blackberry, red currant and thyme punctuated by tarry, leather aromas. The palate shows ample plum flavor layered with chocolate and cinnamon accents, as well as round, polished tannins.",91,35.0,Tuscany
67441,France,"This wine shows that top Chablis should be aged. This is like tasting the barebones of the wine without the flesh that is still very hidden. There is suppressed power, as well as green acidity and potential richness. Wait 5 years.",93,59.0,Burgundy

67449,US,"Lovely aromatics conjure up rose petals, a dash of body powder and ripe citrus. The fruit is very ripe, with almost a candy character, and there's a sensation of powdered sugar.

67452,Chile,"This light-colored, almost clear, SB opens with pungent, fairly sharp aromas of sea brine and sweaty citrus fruits. In the mouth, this is tight, edgy and pointy due to blazing acidity.

67453,New Zealand,"Muskmelon and lime flavors start off tasting sweet, but are quickly reined in by brisk acidity, finishing chalky and tart. This is a fine Riesling, yet slightly disappointing in the context of previous vintages.",86,15.0,Martinborough
67454,US,"The fruit is sourced from the first Syrah plantings in the Walla Walla valley. Tannic and dense, it marries plum fruit flavors to streaks of earth, herb and licorice. A hint of green olive comes into the finish, bolstered by high alcohol and sharp acidity.",90,45.0,Washington
67455,France,"This is a tremendous example of Côte-Rôtie from an irregular vintage. After 20 months in new oak, the wine is a seamless amalgam of roasted meat and charred fruit. The tannins are supple, the extraction and ripeness judged expertly to provide richness without excessive weight. The finish does firm up a bit, so drink it from 2018–2028, and possibly beyond.",93,391.0,Rhône Valley
67456,US,"This tiny-production wine from a great vineyard sings in a layered perfume of roses, forest floor, pomegranate and more nuanced elements of cola and dark cherry.

67462,US,"Shows the elegance and pedigree that this estate vineyard, in the heart of the Oakville bench, always shows.

Should slowly mature over the years.",95,120.0,California
67463,US,"This new release from Waterbrook is a slimmed down version of previous efforts, with rather plain fruit flavors and no discernible new oak influence. Not that that is necessarily a bad thing, but when Chardonnay is built upon little but simple green apple fruit flavors the grape's lack of character sometimes makes you wish for the return of the good old oaky days.",85,13.0,Washington
67464,US,"Bright, fresh and vivacious, this bottling from the historic vineyard offers white flowers, sea salt, lemons and buttered white peaches on the nose.

The wine is classic Russian River, showing full-throttle berry-cherry fruit, balanced with good acidity, while maintaining a delicate mouthfeel. It's complex enough to warrant repeated sipping.",88,40.0,California
67476,France,"This ripe, juicy wine is packed with red fruit. Its tannins are already soft, suggesting it will age quickly. With its crisp aftertaste and plenty of fruitiness, it will be best from 2019.",87,17.0,Bordeaux
67477,Canada,"This is just the second vintage for this winery, whose inviting labels look like handwritten notes. The rosé captures the bright color, fresh fruit and silky texture of its Pinot Noir grape; it's a perfect salmon or turkey wine, and one you could happily sip as an apéritif.",90,24.0,British Columbia
67478,US,"Lots to like in this vibrant young Pinot. It's silky yet has some weight to it, with layers of cherry jam, cola and a spicy meatiness. Should develop interest over the next 5–6 years, but you can certainly drink it now.",90,32.0,California
67479,US,"Lemon mousse aromas and flavors provide the richness and allure of this wine, as steely acidity keeps it fresh and vibrant. Full-bodied, it continues to taste strongly of Gravenstein apple and nutmeg and is bolstered by toasted oak.",90,45.0,California
67480,Italy,"Made from 60% Nero d'Avola, 30% Alicante and 10% Nocera, this offers tobacco, violet and black cherry aromas. The savory palate delivers mature blackberry, carob and black pepper flavors alongside velvety tannins and fresh acidity. Enjoy through 2021.",89,23.0,Sicily & Sardinia

67484,France,"Produced from 40-year-old vines on a 15-acre vineyard, the wine is almost entirely Merlot. It has dense, dark tannins and signs of wood aging that will integrate with time. It is a very fine, rich wine with black-plum fruit flavors. The aftertaste brings out the acidity and black currant fruits.",91,58.0,Bordeaux
67485,France,"This ripe and fruity wine has an edge of tannins to give it structure. It's full of juicy black fruits, rich berry flavors and fresh acidity. The wine will age as the tannins round out further, so drink from 2018.",86,22.0,Bordeaux
67486,US,"Softly tannic, fully dry, and with a peppery edge, this is an elegant Cabernet ready to drink now with a good steak. It has a nice core of juicy blackberries, black cherries and cassis.",87,24.0,California
67487,France,"This fresh wine is all about fruit. Soft tannins and attractive strawberry flavors are lightly cut with acidity. Coming from vines between 50 and 60 years of age, it has some extra concentration. Drink this fragrant wine now.",87,21.0,Burgundy
67488,US,"This blend of 57% Syrah, 35% Grenache, 6% Mourvèdre and 2% Cabernet Sauvignon shows black plums, roasted figs, cinnamon stick, uncrushed clove and star anise on the nose. That great nose doesn't translate yet to the palate, which is sticky with dark plum skin tannins, and proves a bit too leathery for drinking right now. Wait awhile and this one might work better.",85,19.0,California
67489,US,"The best Syrah so far from Cadaretta, this pure varietal is three-quarters Pepper Bridge and one-quarter Stone Tree Vineyard fruit. The purity and focus are compelling. Deep boysenberry fruit is highlighted with black olive and dusty coffee. Tight and expressive.",91,35.0,Washington
67490,Chile,"A nice follow-up to the excellent '08 Zardoz, this is earthy and roasted smelling, full of cola and berry notes on the nose. It feels round and smooth, with a mild tannic bite and baked flavors of blackberry, cassis and chocolate. It's layered feeling on the finish, with a bit of syrupy residue.",90,32.0,Maipo Valley
67491,US,"Not sure what's going on at StoneCap, but after a couple of outstanding Merlot vintages, it seems to have lost its way in 2011. Spritzy, bitter and herbal, there's a big splash of vanilla, as if intended to cover the vegetal flavors of unripe grapes.",82,10.0,Washington
67492,France,"Big, full-bodied and very much a product of the 2010 vintage, this structured, generous wine needs time. The dry tannins are still prominent, giving a tough edge to the more generous, concentrated fruits. Drink from 2018.",88,30.0,Bordeaux
67493,US,"This impressive wine from estate-grown fruit, including 10% Cabernet Franc, is tightly woven, fleshy and youthful, with smoky cedar and dark cherry notes. Powerfully structured, it shows a classic approach to ripeness and oak, integrating both well and with restraint.",90,80.0,California
67494,US,"A woody, toasted note speaks to well-integrated yet present oak in this white that maintains medium-bodied texture on the palate. Bright, lemony acidity complements the creaminess, dashing in wet stone and undeniable floral notes of apple and orange blossom.",91,24.0,California
67495,US,"This leads with aromas of dark raspberries, toast and woodspice, seeming to still be in its shell. Flavors are high-octane, rich and sweet, with enough tannins to go the distance. It doesn't seem entirely integrated right now, but it will go up a notch or two if it comes together.",91,60.0,Washington
67496,France,"Full-bodied for a rosé (as Tavel should be), this wine boasts plenty of cherry-berry fruit, but also appealing, complex notes of fresh thyme, ground clove and aniseed.

67497,Italy,"This is a well-integrated super Tuscan blend of Sangiovese and Cabernet Sauvignon, although the 2005 vintage doesn't have quite the same intensity as 2004. The wine is well defined and sharp in the mouth with a tonic and bright quality of fruit.",91,60.0,Tuscany
67498,France,"A blend of 60% Grenache and 40% Syrah, this medium-bodied wine is slightly confected and bubble-gum-like at first. With a bit of air, it takes on simple, fruity and direct flavors of cherries and berries, but finishes clean and dry. Drink now.",85,14.0,Rhône Valley
67499,US,"Starting out reductive, this wine has aromas of wet copper penny, fresh herbs, woodspice and dark fruit. The coffee and black fruit flavors are high octane, seeming out of balance.",86,25.0,Washington
67500,Austria,"A barely-there glimpse of lemon bids you to step closer and take a sip. The palate unfolds in a still tightly contained bundle of lemon zest and juiciness. There is an undertow of riper texture, reminiscent of bitter orange zest and just as full of aromatic promise. This is wiry and slender but will mellow into seductive freshness and slick, almost cheeky tartness. With this concentration, it has all the makings of a flavor bomb and is something to really look forward to. Drink 2018–2030.",95,85.0,Wachau
67501,US,"Showing just a hint of sweetness, this well-rounded effort offers a ripe and tangy mix of lime, grapefruit, pineapple and white peach fruit flavors. There's a touch of honey running alongside and trickling out through the finish. It's drinking at or near its peak.",89,16.0,Oregon
67502,Italy,"Aromas of mature black-skinned berry, wild mint, dill, coffee and tobacco emerge on this full-bodied red.

67503,US,"While unusual for the variety, the herb, lemon and orange zest, berry, green pepper and asphalt aromas provide intrigue. The fruit flavors are plump but light, showing good length. This wine provides enjoyment, though Merlot wouldn't be a first guess.",88,20.0,Washington
67504,Spain,"Creamy oak and raisiny notes announce ripeness and richness that turn to complexity as this Syrah airs out. In the mouth, this is full-force, with choppy tannins and tomato-like acidity.

67505,US,"A very nice wine that shows the smooth, complex tannin structure, ripe fruit and dry balance you'd want from a Napa Valley Cabernet Sauvignon. You'll like the blackberry, cherry and cedar flavors, enhanced by touches of dried herb and cocoa. Drink now–2015 for fruity freshness.",90,45.0,California
67506,France,"The aromatic tang of ripe lemon peel plays on the nose. The palate is pervaded by the same refreshing zestiness, shimmering with cheerful citrus brightness amidst riper notions of pear and peach. This is mouth-watering stuff, almost addictive with its dry zesty finish.",92,18.0,Alsace

67512,US,"Sweet with the aroma of ripe, red plum preserves and a touch of green herbs, this is a lovely blend of Cab Franc, Merlot and Cabernet Sauvignon with hints of toasted oak. Soft and lush with a cherry pie filling palate, it's an easygoing, medium-bodied wine with a pleasant, fruit-forward profile.",86,25.0,New York
67513,US,"This rich, spicy wine comes from the eastern part of the valley. It's very full-bodied, almost coarse now, but that's a function of its fresh tannins and brisk acidity. Tastes jammy in cherry-berry pie filling, with a sweet, smoky oak veneer. Needs 4–6 years, but if you drink it now, decant.",92,42.0,California
67514,France,"This is a finely structured wine with the right amount of fruit. With black-currant flavors and plenty of the acidity that is typical of the year, the wine is perfumed, refreshing and likely to develop quickly. Drink starting from 2017.",88,15.0,Bordeaux
67515,Chile,"A lot of Chilean Cabernets seem to have a distinct weediness to them; this is a perfect example of the style, boasting green hay and herb aromas over subdued—almost stewed—cassis fruit. Some tart acidity keeps things lively on the finish.",81,10.0,Maipo Valley
67516,Australia,"For the price, this is pretty decent. It shows ample volume in the mouth and features lightly stewed fruit notes of mixed berries balanced by a touch of wood.",85,11.0,South Australia
67517,US,"This bold, boisterous wine offers a depth of black cherry and is expansive on the palate, tingling in spicy acidity and swathes of cinnamon-laced cola.

67519,US,"An excellent trio of vineyards—Minnick Hills, Pepper Bridge, and Alder Ridge—contribute to this substantial effort. The fruit is dense and lively, with spicy, tangy mixed berry, currant and cherry character. The tannins have been nicely polished, and the acids provide the underpinning that gives the wine its lift. Despite its power, the wine keeps the alcohol in check, without a trace of heat or burn.",90,32.0,Washington
67520,France,"This is a light and very fruity wine from vineyards in the hills above Nuits Saint-Georges. It has just fruit, light tannins and considerable acidity. The wine is crisp, bright and will be ready to drink from 2017.",85,30.0,Burgundy
67521,US,"If Napa Cabernet is your touchstone you'll find harder tannins and acids than you're used to. It's a bone-dry wine with blackberry, black currant and oak flavors that are grounded with tobacco and sage.",86,42.0,California
67522,US,"Overly ripe and sugary sweet, this Merlot, with a splash of Cab, has a rustic feeling. There is ripe fruit and fine tannins, but the sweetness is a problem.",83,25.0,California

67524,Australia,"Yes, a certain amount of acidity is desirable in Australian Riesling, but this one is exceedingly lean and crisp. Perhaps it will blossom with age, but for now it is simply intensely citrusy and rather skinny. Pair it with oysters, or put it in a cool dark place and hope for the best.",85,16.0,South Australia
67525,US,"Lemon-lime acidity cuts a laser-sharp edge through honey in this lush, concentrated Riesling full of pink grapefruit, mango and peach flavors. It's a lip smacking, juicy wine, yet stands up to even the most elegant occasions. Drink now.",90,15.0,New York

67527,US,"This wine is still coming out of its shell, with lightly reduced aromas of mandarin orange, fresh flowers, and citrus. It drinks bone dry, with silky-feeling fruit flavors providing intrigue but not entirely delivering. The aromas and flavors don't seem to match up.",86,11.0,Washington
67528,US,"Blackberries, violet and black-slate aromas mix with a bit of soy sauce on this blend of 62% Cabernet Sauvignon, 20% Mourvèdre and 18% Grenache, grown in what today is known as the San Miguel District of Paso Robles.

67530,France,"This rich barrel-aged wine is a blend of 50-50 Merlot and Cabernet Franc. It is a small, seven-acre estate just outside the village of Saint-Émilion.

Drink from 2022.",91,27.0,Bordeaux
67531,France,"The ripe fruit of the vintage is really apparent in this firm wine. Its tannins and spicy character are contrasted with balanced black currant fruit and acidity. It will need some time, so drink from 2019.",87,23.0,Bordeaux
67532,New Zealand,"For one of the region's pioneers, this medium-bodied wine is somewhat underwhelming. The core grapefruit flavors suffer from pervasive hints of green onion that seemingly grow in influence from nose to palate to finish.",85,17.0,Marlborough
67533,US,"Named for a small family property in the south of France, this wine is all about small production and small lots. Fruit is sourced from the grand Klopp Thorn Ridge Ranch. Slightly cloudy, the wine is powerful and concentrated in oak at first, followed by ripe, bright approachable red fruit. Give it through 2020 to get even better.",90,59.0,California
67534,US,"Laetita's Les Galets bottling comes from a single vineyard block. The '06 is rich, velvety, complex and compelling. Fully dry, it has remarkably deep, tannin-inspired flavors of cherry pie, currants, mocha, licorice, peppercorn and smoky new oak. Just addictive, and should hold well for six years.",94,60.0,California

67540,Austria,"Ripe Bosc pear with its textured peel sets the tone. An underlying base of luscious ripeness, is cut through with lively, zesty lemon freshness. It resonates with fruit at the very height of its expression: a pleasant edge of bitterness, ample texture, concentration and authenticity.",94,55.0,Wachau
67541,Chile,"Comfortable enough, with common aromas of black fruit, spice, earth and leather. Given that production on this wine is now a whopping million cases, anything palatable should be considered a success. Casillero has reasonably good plum, cassis and brambly flavors, with a hint of oak in support. The mouthfeel is narrow, but overall the wine tastes real.",85,12.0,Central Valley

67544,Chile,"On the nose, this smells like bath soap or air freshener. It feels fleshy and oily on the palate, with tropical flavors of banana and papaya. The finish is smooth and tastes of candy.",84,12.0,Central Valley
67545,US,"There's compelling balance between the baked red cherry fruit, graphite-like minerality and brown spice on the nose of this bottling, further enhanced by leather and earth aromas. Bright raspberry meets with cooked strawberry and licorice flavors on the palate, where a somewhat frothy texture is powered by acidity atop soft yet somewhat structuring tannins.",93,42.0,California
67546,US,"Someone explain this labeling: La Creole Vineyard is a blend of 96% Feltz Vineyard and 4% Madrona Vineyard? No matter the name, it smells good, boasting plenty of smoky and woodsy aromas. The flavors are immature, almost grapey still, with some unintegrated vanilla and toast from oak, and fine tannins on the finish. Needs some time; give it a couple of years’ rest before popping your first cork.",89,25.0,Oregon
67547,US,"Rather heavy in texture, with the weight of a Rhone wine, and thick, fruity flavors of plums, heirloom tomatoes, cola, espresso and oak. Very dry, with smooth tannins. This is a big Pinot, clean and complex, although not particularly delicate.",87,33.0,California
67548,US,"Light black raspberry and purple-flower aromas show on the somewhat shy nose of this bottling from the Jackson Family's longtime Santa Maria Valley winery.

67549,Italy,"Violet, ripe berry and a whiff of sweet cake spice lead the nose on this straightforward red. The bright, easy-drinking palate offers crushed wild cherry, raspberry, white pepper and cinnamon. Fresh acidity and silky tannins give it an approachable, easygoing nature.",87,,Tuscany
67550,US,"Full and piquant aromas of black fruit, purple flowers, asphalt and pepper make for a rich and flowery nose on this bottling. Concentrated flavors of black currant and black plum ride a relatively light and airy body all the way into a grippy tannin-laced finish.",92,48.0,California

67554,US,"Sometimes in a challenging vintage such as 2009, it is the least expensive, blended wines that benefit most, perhaps because grapes normally destined for the single-vineyard wines are redirected. Here, rich fruit flavors highlighted with streaks of caramel and toffee get things rolling quickly. Berries and cherries, firm acids, pretty spice and a lingering butterscotch finish.",91,45.0,Oregon

67558,Argentina,"A different style of Mendoza Malbec (with 30% Merlot), and for the most part it's intriguing and satisfying. For starters, the bouquet is a true bouquet: there's funky spice, cinnamon stick and floral fruit aromas. The palate has some snap and acidic sharpness, but also good blackberry essence. Finishes smoother than up front, with woodspice and pepper coming on strong. Drink now through 2010.",88,43.0,Mendoza Province
67559,France,"Fresh and juicy, this full-bodied while structured wine comes from the heart of the Entre-deux-Mers region, which gives the fruitiness and blackberry fruit flavors. It will develop quickly and can be drunk from 2016.",87,20.0,Bordeaux

67563,US,"Fresh and broad aromas of strawberry syrup meet with eucalyptus oil and wild mint on the clean if simple nose of this bottling.

67565,France,"This is a young, beautifully fruity wine. Lemon and lime chase ripe yellow fruits and pears that are all lifted by spice and acidity. It is perfumed, rich and concentrated from the old vines. The aftertaste is mineral and tight. Drink from 2020.",93,,Burgundy
67566,US,"With 50% new oak, there's a lot of buttered toast and smoky vanilla on this Chard, but the fruit easily handles it. Fabulously rich in pineapple, honey and crème brûlée. Soft and fat in the mouth, maybe with a touch of botrytis. Very fine, extraordinary opulence. Drink now.",93,40.0,California
67567,US,"Bright and spicy, this wine makes an immediate impact. The blueberry fruit has a sassy edge, and it penetrates through the middle into a finish with notes of black licorice, baking spices and coffee grounds. Firm, full and tight, the wine should age nicely now through 2025.",92,36.0,Oregon
67568,Germany,"For such a small price, this off-dry Riesling offers surprising refreshment and enjoyment.

67570,US,"There's lots to like in this affordable Merlot, and it's not just the fantastic label of a young, beautiful Marilyn Monroe. The wine itself is dry and firm in tannins, with blackberry and chocolate-covered raisin flavors. The alcohol is a refreshingly low 12.5% by volume. A great accomplishment. Production was 4,000 cases.",88,12.0,California
67571,Italy,"This blend of Montepulciano and Aglianico offers deep notes of resin, spice, plum, black fruit, cherry and root beer. The wine has a slightly raw quality with nervous tannins that are characteristic of both grape varieties but many years in the bottle have softened them.",88,22.0,Southern Italy
67572,Italy,"What makes this Sangiovese and Cabernet Sauvignon blend stand out are its pristine balsam notes. Those beautifully pungent aromas are followed by exotic spice, black cherry, maple syrup and tobacco. The wine boasts deep concentration of color and flavors and obvious sophistication. It's a bit thick and sticky in the mouth with heavy wood tones and gritty tannins.",90,35.0,Tuscany
67573,US,"This is an enormous Cabernet, as packed with intensity and power as anything in Napa Valley. The vineyard is Von Strasser's highest on the mountain, which maximally exposes it to the sun, and you can taste the solar ripeness in the intense essence of black currants and dark chocolate.

67577,US,"A taut, tense fight between the acids and sugars highlight this excellent dessert wine. A strong streak of spicy grain runs straight through the compact citrus and honey fruit flavors.

67580,US,"This is the first offering of this wine where Cabernet Franc (37%) takes the lead, blended with Cabernet Sauvignon (27%), Merlot (23%), Malbec (7%) and Petit Verdot.

67581,US,"Lutum is a project from Santa Barbara vintner Gavin Chanin. The brand sources fruit from well-known vineyards, in this case Rinconada, situated in a favorable terroir in the southern part of the appellation. The wine is quite pale and the alcohol level is low, giving it great delicacy. But it's potent in raspberry, red currant, spicy red licorice and softened cola flavors. Delicious now, it will age well until at least 2022.",92,50.0,California

67586,US,"This is a deliciously sultry, luxurious and yet lean, focused white, dark gold in color with tightly woven acidity.

67587,Italy,"Mature black plum, tobacco, crushed violet, cake spice and toast aromas mingle together in the glass. The taut full-bodied palate delivers dried black cherry, prune, espresso, orange peel and licorice alongside a backbone of close-grained tannins. This is still extremely young and tightly wound, so give it time to fully develop. Drink 2019–2029.",93,170.0,Veneto
67588,France,"Tight and fruity, this is a crisp wine with considerable acidity. It has a fresh, crisp background, cut with a mineral texture and a stony, steely character. This wine, with its structure, needs to age; drink from 2017.",90,,Burgundy
67589,US,"A new offering from the Sonoma-based producer meant to recall the estate's original founding in the Napa Valley, this wine sources from across that appellation and impresses right away in its succulent and soft approach to the variety.

67594,France,"With rich tropical fruits and a ripe, opulent feel, this is a full-bodied wine. It has weight, layers of toast and apricot and peach flavors. Soft and round, it could be drunk now, although it would be best to wait until 2015.",89,26.0,Burgundy
67595,France,Caramel and ripe red fruits show the weight of this wine. It has freshness from the warm plum flavors along with ripe accents of spice and pepper. The end has tangy acidity. Bordeaux Clairet lies between rosé and red in color and in taste.,87,,Bordeaux
67596,France,"Ammonites are the fossils found in the chalk soil of Sancerre. This wine certainly shows the right mineral texture, very crisp and tight. It's full of citrus, zesty orange and apple skins. It needs to develop, wait until 2015.",91,35.0,Loire Valley
67597,France,"The wine is all fruit initially and then the firmer tannins kick in. It has a strongly tannic core that leaves the wine dry and tough after 12 months in barrel. The fruit weight should broaden the wine out, giving black fruitiness in the future. Drink from 2017.",88,17.0,Bordeaux
67598,US,"Stylistically, this Pinot is right in the middle of the big, blowsy style and the more austere, low-alcohol style. It's balanced, dry and rich in cherry and raspberry-pie flavors, with an opulent overlay of sweet, smoky oak. Drink now–2015.",91,34.0,California

67603,Austria,"A touch of peach is edged with leafy notes of citrus foliage and a touch of elderflower.

67608,US,"The word “reserve“ is hidden on the back label. Another surprise—under the thick wax capsule is a glass seal, certain to ambush more than a few unsuspecting cork-pullers!

67609,US,"This dry, complex Cabernet Sauvignon bears classic Napa tannins, plus layers of blackberry, black currant, violet, mineral and cedar flavors. The grapes were grown in the Coombsville area. Drink now, after decanting, and continue to drink it through 2016.",92,55.0,California
67610,US,"This Syrah has a fine, complex structure of tannins and acids, with flashy black currant and oak flavors.

67613,Spain,"Heavy aromas of baked berry fruits and raisin suggest a bit of overripeness. On the palate, that take is confirmed by chunky weight offset by natural acidity.

67614,New Zealand,"Full-bodied, plush and ripe, this is a bit of a throwback style of Chardonnay, marrying peach, vanilla and mango notes into a delectable whole. Toasted oak gives a bit of structure without straitjacketing the luscious fruit. Drink now–2018.",91,30.0,Hawke's Bay
67615,US,"Arinarnoa (a crossing of Petit Verdot and Merlot), Merlot, Petit Sirah and Nebbiolo go into this diverse blend.

67616,US,"Doesn't say so on the label, but this is 100% Cabernet Sauvignon, from the Atlas Peak area. Very dry and tannic, with an astringent lockdown, it's functionally undrinkable now, but it does show the intensity of this mountainous region for Cabernet, with explosive blackberry, blueberry and black currant flavors. All indications are that it's an ager. Hold until 2015, at the very least.",94,95.0,California
67617,US,"Seeming delicate at first, barely-there whiffs of lemon peel and green herb turn riper and sunnier on this dry, medium-bodied Riesling.

A cool strike of steel extends from midpalate to finish, lending mineral elegance to this ripe, rich wine.",92,29.0,New York
67618,New Zealand,"The nose is an interesting blend of cocoa, dill, cassis and lemon. Flavors pretty much follow suit, sneaking in some tobacco and cedar shadings before turning lean and lemony. The finish shows off a whack of dry, cedary French oak. Hard to know where this will be in five years—might dry out, might get interestingly complex.",85,20.0,Hawke's Bay
67619,US,"Candied blackberry aromas meld with tar, rosemary and fennel in this balanced and expertly ripe wine from one of the pioneering families in Temecula.

67626,France,"This is a crisp, medium-bodied example of Saint-Joseph. Aromas of creosote, black olives and roasting meat receive an infusion of brighter, fruitier flavors on the palate, adding cherries to the savory mix. Drink this mouthwatering wine over the next few years.",87,30.0,Rhône Valley

67628,Chile,"Aromas of mango, pineapple and petrol are pure Riesling. Plump on the palate, with citrusy acidity, this tastes of green melon, lime and tarragon. On the finish, a simple, sweet melony flavor blends into a sharper grapefruit note.",89,20.0,Bío Bío Valley
67629,US,"Full bodied and softly tannic, this wine's fruit is front and center, wrapped in a subtle jacket of sweet oak. It dazzles with blackberries, cherries, raspberries, currants and chocolate flavors. Drink now for its sheer lusciousness.",90,32.0,California
67630,Spain,"Spiced berry aromas are dense and suggest raisin, but overall this is a clean, inexpensive blend of Garnacha and Tempranillo that is satisfying and highly competent.

67631,Italy,"Dense and hearty, this has subtle aromas of stewed prune, espresso and French oak. The brawny palate offers blackberry extract, licorice, ground pepper and the heat of evident alcohol alongside tightly packed, close-grained tannins that leave an astringent finish. Give the tannins another year or two to unfurl then drink up before the remaining fruit dries up.",87,35.0,Tuscany
67632,France,"A concentrated, hugely rich wine with lively caramel and toast aromas, followed by ripe fruits. It is generous and open, with apricots and nectarines giving richness, while kiwi gives the green, crisp character. The aftertaste is all minerality. Screwcap.",93,60.0,Burgundy
67633,US,"Sharp-edged aromas show classic notes of grass and fresh asparagus. In the mouth, it pulls the fruit forward: there are lightly honeyed flavors of melon and peach with a slightly sugary, short finish.",86,28.0,Oregon
67634,Spain,"Overall this Callet-led blend might exceed its more oaked, richer brother known as Son Negre. Àn has a rooty, oak-driven nose with hints of herbs and tobacco, while the palate is dark and tasty, with blackberry, cherry and cured meat flavors. Finishes with pepper and a lash of leftover oak that hopefully will disappear as the wine ages. Drink now through 2012.",89,53.0,Spanish Islands
67635,Chile,"Calina's first attempt at a super Chilean is successful. The wine, a multiappellation blend, really pops in the mouth. The fruit is ripe and the power is there. However, for someone looking for a reserved red made in the Bordeaux style, something that Chile can deliver, this could come across as aggressive, as the acidity is a bit sharp.",89,50.0,Colchagua Valley
67636,France,"A ripe, smooth and fruity wine that is already delicious in its ripe berry and plum flavors. Touches of new wood show how it is still developing, a burst of vanilla followed by fruity acidity. It will be a full, ripe wine, but give it until 2016.",88,25.0,Bordeaux
67637,New Zealand,"So-named for the restricted yields, this is the rare Marlborough Pinot Noir that may offer some longevity. The mix of bottle sweetness, button mushroom and tart cherry flavors are intriguingly complex, while the mouthfeel still features some tannic heft. It will be interesting to see how or if this evolves further. Drink now–2015 or so.",90,20.0,Marlborough
67638,US,"From a sloped vineyard in Green Valley, this impressive wine is spicy in cardamom with plenty of forest floor character, a tanginess dominant on the full-bodied palate. Orange zest and cranberry accent fine-tuned tannin and subtle oak.",91,54.0,California

67641,New Zealand,"Impressively rich, velvety and long, this appears to have all the ingredients for cellaring.

67645,US,"This suave and sophisticated wine is so smooth to sip that its depth of flavor is a little deceptive. A subtle potpourri of clove, cinnamon, black tea and blackberry aromas swirl around a great core of mild acidity, fine-grained tannins and many layers of concentrated fruit flavor. The texture is velvety and the finish lingers for at least 30 seconds.",93,32.0,California
67646,Italy,"Aromas of pipe tobacco, mature dark-skinned fruit, leather and cake spice meld together on this smooth structured red. The chewy, full-bodied palate delivers mature plum, black cherry marinated in spirits, mocha and cinnamon alongside velvety tannins. Drink 2017 through 2026.",92,65.0,Veneto
67647,US,"Has to be one of the most forward, immediately drinkable Pisoni Pinots out there. It's enormously flattering in raspberries, cherries, currants and cola, with sweet toasty oak complexities. The acidity is gorgeous, the tannins soft. There's no reason to age this beautiful wine, so drink it now and through 2016.",92,67.0,California
67648,South Africa,"A dark and rich style of Merlot, this wine boasts intense aromas and flavors of black forest berries, plum flesh, cocoa powder and pencil shavings. Succulent, with a creamy texture, the tannins are fine but mouth-coating and provide a good frame to the sultry flavors. Chocolate and cedar spice linger on the close.",90,25.0,Stellenbosch
67649,US,"A great wine that combines the modern, ultraripe winemaking style with Rutherford's fine, complex tannins and herbs.

67651,Spain,"Round, big and medicinal, with clumsy, roasted berry fruit aromas. The palate isn't overly charming, and the flavors of tomato paste, cranberry and herbal red fruit are curious.

67652,US,"Showy, dramatic but sophisticated oak nuances merge beautifully with red and black-cherry flavors and a just-lively-enough texture in this medium-bodied, concentrated and well-focused wine.

67653,Chile,"Leafy herbal aromas of tomato sauce and spicy red plum will be attractive or too green depending on your point of view. This has a snappy freshness to the palate, while flavors of red plum, herbs and tomato finish comfortably, with an Old World essence.",87,18.0,Maipo Valley

67656,US,"This is a smoothly crafted, delicate blend of 61% Cabernet Sauvignon, 32% Merlot and 7% Cabernet Franc.

Subtle spice box, cedar and cigar add to its complexity and length.",94,110.0,California
67657,Chile,"Straightforward punchbowl aromas greet you, and beyond that there's melon to the nose.

Perfectly good and competent.",86,13.0,Central Valley
67658,US,"The concept here is a southern Rhône blend—47% Syrah, 17% Grenache, 19% Cinsault and 17% Mourvèdre. With the extra dollop of Syrah, it's got more substance than the usual Châteauneuf wannabes. Spicy and sharp, this benefits from the fact that the grapes all came in at once and were co-fermented, so the blend married early and well. Despite its youth, this is seamless and focused; a complete and very successful wine with berry, cherry and sweet plum fruit flavors annotated with spice and bits of chocolate. Elegant, feminine and supple, this is a lovely bottle.",91,32.0,Washington

67662,US,"Still spritzy, very tart and tangy, with orange peel and lemon drop flavors. Perhaps showing just a bit more intensity than the 2006, this is a terrific follow-up with the same mix of delicacy and power that suggests that the Columbia Gorge AVA may well be the best site in the Pacific Northwest to grow Riesling.",91,14.0,Oregon
67663,US,"This new project by wine bar owner Ash Mehta and winemaker Mary Bradley shows much promise, starting with woody elderberry, tar, black pepper and dense lavender on the buoyant nose.

67671,US,"Black cherry, chipped slate and cola notes lavish the nose on this top-end bottling of best barrels from the single-vineyard specialist.

67673,US,"Minty, this restrained Syrah is from a sought-after vineyard, a pioneer in Sonoma County Rhône-style wines.

High in acidity, it needs time to come together; try after 2020.",91,38.0,California
67674,France,"Bold and very clumsy. There are leathery elements to the nose and wild, grapy fruit that stumbles onto the palate. A wall of tannins hits you on the finish, and throughout it's untamed and overdone. Very fruity and forward, but devoid of tact.",80,8.0,Languedoc-Roussillon

67679,US,"This is a stunner because it shows such minerally depth, which many strive for but few achieve on a pink wine. The classic shade of pink gives way to bubblegum, lime juice, orange rind and smashed raspberry aromas. The zesty, vibrant lime juice acidity cuts right through plum fruit, but it's the graphite and chalky tension that wins the palate.",91,20.0,California

67682,France,"The wine develops slowly in the glass, closed at first and then bringing on ripe fruits and firm tannins. There is a definite dryness here, solid, textured and darkly structured. It is meant for aging, so don't drink before 2016.",90,13.0,Bordeaux
67683,US,"Not much going on in this soft, direct Chardonnay, besides sweet oak, with its buttered toast, vanilla and butterscotch flavors. Way underneath is pineapple and lemondrop fruit.",85,32.0,California
67684,US,"From the start this has superb tannins and fine acidity that frame the ripe, complex blackberry, black currant and cassis flavors, finishing with elegance and class. It's hard to resist drinking now, but this should develop over the next eight years.",92,75.0,California
67685,France,"In a very Corsican style, this is a totally crisp blend of Nieillucciu, Sciaccarellu and Grenache. The first grape lends intense acidity while adding red currant and orange fruitiness. Drink now.",87,25.0,France Other
67686,US,"A full 13-years-old on release, this wine is in perfect bloom, with tertiary aromas of leather, dried cherry, cocoa and vanilla. The cranberry and cherry flavors are tart and lithe, lingering on the finish. It still has life in front of it but is in a sweet spot.",91,48.0,Washington
67687,US,"Fruity, silky and simple, with jammy flavors of raspberries and red cherries, tobacco and spice. Feels light and pleasant in the mouth, but could use more stuffing.",85,32.0,California
67688,France,"89-91. Barrel sample. This wine shows firm tannins, yet is also fruity. It feels light and fresh with attractive acidity and a crisp touch.",90,,Bordeaux
67689,US,"Bottled in a lovely 500 ml bottle, with a label of cut paper with butterflies, this was barrel fermented in neutral oak. It's a beautiful color, a coppery salmon, much like rosé de Provence (where winemaker Virginie Bourgue is from). It's dry and fruity, but more complex than most newly released rosés, with light berry fruits, a lovely texture, and a finish that suggests malted milk chocolate candy.",88,16.0,Washington
67690,Chile,"Clos Apalta, depending on your point of view, is arguably Chile's best wine. And this vintage is outstanding! Earth, minty spice, ripe berry, minerality and smoky aromas cover the bases. It's superbly structured, with a fine texture and depth. Tastes lush and complex, with blackberry, crème de cassis, fine herbs and tobacco. Finishes classy. Drink now through 2016.",95,90.0,Colchagua Valley
67691,US,"Delicate and detailed, this balanced Pinot Noir displays a perfect mix of wild berry, mushroom, green tea and a whiff of compost. These threads of flavor, and others associated with them, create a delightful tapestry that continues through the lengthy finish.",91,65.0,Oregon
67692,Italy,"Aromas of spiced plum, dark-skinned berry, leather and a balsamic note waft out of the glass. The firm palate delivers juicy wild cherry, white pepper, game and aniseed alongside firm but polished tannins and fresh acidity. Drink 2015–2020.",92,40.0,Tuscany
67693,Italy,"Blue flower, ripe berry and baking spice aromas unfold in the glass of this blend of Sangiovese, Sagrantino, Cabernet and Merlot. The juicy palate delivers black cherry, vanilla, cinnamon and espresso alongside bracing tannins.",89,23.0,Central Italy
67694,US,"South African winemaker Ernst Storm is one to watch. This bottling offers a smoky, black raspberry nose, with hints of brown mustard and beef char. There's tremendous energy on the palate, though it's rather light in body, with flavors of anise, black rocks approaching asphalt, and dark but not overly ripe plums. Solid tannins ensure more interesting drinking 2017–2025.",92,55.0,California
67695,Greece,"This is a friendly red with aromas of cinnamon, red berry and pepper, followed by a lightly sweet combination of vanilla, cherry and strawberry. Easy drinking and soft overall, this will pair well with many dishes—turkey, pork and lamb alike.",86,15.0,Peloponnese
67696,France,"A rich and bold wine, structured and concentrated. This is packed with black plum fruits, ripe damsons and sweet tannins. There's a great juicy element, that brings in the acidity as well as some spice from wood aging.",90,,Bordeaux
67697,US,"A rough, common Pinot Noir. It's all right for drinking now, with pleasant cherry, berry, cola and cedar flavors that have an edge of overripe raisins.",84,85.0,California
67698,Germany,"Zesty lemon and lime skins perfume this dry, steely Riesling. It's bold in body yet edged with razor-sharp acidity. The midpalate yields slowly with touches of quince and tangerine that linger nicely through the finish.",89,70.0,Nahe
67699,Italy,"The aromas are awkward, with notes of clove, green stock, bramble, linseed oil, Sambuca and spice that come from every direction. The wine is firm in the mouth with solid tannins and herbal notes on the close.",83,25.0,Tuscany
67700,US,"A Cab-based wine with 20% Merlot, this has juicy blackberry and currant to soften the overreaching tannic profile. Blessed in cedar and tobacco, this also presents a strong showing of dried herb. The fruit leans black and blue, from blueberry to black plum, a nod to the Merlot.",88,50.0,California
67701,US,"Beet and plum juice aromas meet with hearty clove and juniper spice on the nose of this bottling from a vineyard located 16 miles from the Pacific Ocean. It's a dark and deep expression on the sip, with blackberry, wet earth and pine-forest flavors, proving quite muscular and manly, with a menthol lift on the finish.",92,65.0,California
67702,US,"Clean and nice upfront, with blackberry aromas and sweet vanilla. A lot of heft to the palate, and plenty of cassis flavor and tobacco nuance on the finish. Oak rears up on the finish. Needs some time.",91,45.0,California
67703,US,"Interesting scents of spice, herb and pine mix with tropical pineapple fruit. It all leads into a buttery finish, delivering a lot of flavor for the price. Barrel fermented, malolactic and sur lie aging—the full Monty.",86,10.0,Washington
67704,US,"There's a drily tannic texture that gives this very ripe Cab structure and balance. Thoroughly dry, it tastes of red and black currants, smoky oak and peppery, dusty Asian spices. Gets better and better as it unfolds in the glass.",89,50.0,California
67705,US,"A shade off the 2005, being leaner and more tannic, and more akin to the 2001. It's a dry, taut Cab, marked by a drying astringency accompanying the blackberry and mineral flavors. Drink now–2012.",87,40.0,California
67706,US,"Apparently the Oregon Trail leads down to Santa Rosa, where this wine was cellared and bottled. Long-distance travel aside, it's a good wine for gulping, matching red currant fruit to a generous wash of black tea and tobacco. Flavors pull up a bit short, but by then the next swallow is already on the way.",87,19.0,Oregon
67707,US,"This wine has very dark flavor characteristics, and is almost completely dominated by the oak barrels (40% American) in which it’s been aging for 33 months. That’s a long time, and American oak has strong aromas and flavors, perhaps too strong. The tannins are pretty and supple, and the fruit that’s buried under all that wood seems lovely, but this wine should have been released two years ago.",83,22.0,California
67708,France,"A perfumed wine, deliciously accessible now. The damson and red plum fruits push through a light tannic core. It's a wine with a pure Pinot character, very linear and ready to drink.",88,,Burgundy
67709,US,"Deeply brooding notes of crushed violets, rose petals, black cherries, thyme and sagebrush make for a manly take on this often feminine grape. Elderberry fruit shows on the palate, as do more violets and lilacs, dried mint, sagebrush, menthol and pine-needle flavors.",91,36.0,California
67710,US,"This is rich and dry in blackberries, licorice, bacon, sweet oak and peppery spices. It shows lots of acidity and tannins, giving it a firm structure. Give it a brief decant and drink now.",87,28.0,California

67712,France,"Attractive, wood and yellow fruit laden wine. It's soft, rounded with bright acidity and a spicy character. It's wood probably needs to soften over the next few months.",87,,Burgundy
67713,US,"A deliciously likeable Pinot Noir, sweet as a raspberry crumble pie, yet with qualities of mushrooms, minerals and something formidable from the earth that give it great complexity. The winemaker, Drake Whitcraft, has kept the alcohol to a relatively low 13.4% by volume, so the wine feels light and airy. Yet it possesses great seriousness. The vineyard is within a touchdown pass of the Santa Rita Hills boundary. Drink now–2020.",92,50.0,California
67714,US,"Massively rich and sweet in blackberries, cherries, cola and oak, this Cabernet trades complexity and dryness for sheer razzle-dazzle. It's an impressive, show-offy wine, but if you want to cellar it, you're a gambler.",90,55.0,California
67715,France,"A ripe perfumed wine with fine tannins as well as dense fruit. Blackberry flavors are up there along with the acidity and crisp aftertaste. It's a wine with a good future, ready to drink from 2018.",89,15.0,Bordeaux
67716,US,"This well-made full-bodied wine exudes a juicy core of red currant, cranberry and vanilla as a persistence of tannin provides power and wooded support. Oak and cedar play nicely together and add a wealth of savory concentration.",89,60.0,California
67717,New Zealand,"Grassy, herbal notes accent grapefruit and lime aromas, while riper hints of stone fruit sneak in on the palate, adding roundness and weight. Dusty, slightly chalky nuances on the finish give the impression of dry minerality.",90,26.0,Marlborough
67718,US,"Riding the delicate balance between ripeness and freshness, Adam Comartin's bottling shows warm white peach and toasted cashew on the nose alongside sea salt, tangerine pith, white jasmine, light honey and apple crème brûlée aromas. Ripe stonefruit flavors are deftly cut by sizzling acidity on the palate.",92,35.0,California
67719,US,"This very limited block selection is too thin, herbal and green to offer much pleasure. Tannins are stemmy and overtake the fruit.",85,65.0,Oregon
67720,Italy,"A blend of Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, Syrah, Montepulciano, Sangiovese and a drop of Petit Verdot, this has aromas of pressed blue flower, dark-skinned berry and toast. The firm, straightforward palate offers black currant, clove and a hint of tobacco. Fine-grained tannins proved the frame work.",88,18.0,Tuscany
67721,US,"With only 12.5% alcohol by volume, this young-vine Chardonnay is one of the lightest, most delicate Chardonnays the winery has ever produced. But it's not shy on flavor, delivering waves of tropical fruits, peaches, vanilla and buttered toast. Long and sweet in honey, it finishes dry and racy. Defines the new elegant style of Chardonnay.",92,36.0,California
67722,Chile,"Cherry, raspberry and cocoa aromas set up a full-bodied palate with juicy acidity and all sorts of red-berry flavor that's both bright and medicinal in character. It falls on the ripe and ready side, with bold fruit and a peppery, spicy finish.",91,40.0,Casablanca Valley
67723,Germany,"While the nose seems a bit savory, with muted apple and honeycomb notes, this dry, full-bodied Riesling is quite fruity on the palate, with pleasant peach and nectarine flavors. It's brisk, with lemon-lime acidity and just a hint of astringency on the finish.",86,12.0,Pfalz
67724,US,"Thin and dry, this wine has Pinot's silky mouthfeel, but little else. The mushroom, cola and spearmint flavors are relieved by some cherry fruit. Not going anywhere, so drink up.",84,55.0,California
67725,US,"This is a simple, one-dimensional Chardonnay. It's dry in style with thin citrus and apricot flavors and just a hint of oak.",82,12.0,California

67728,Bulgaria,"Deep ruby in color, this wine offers aromas of cherry, blackberry and tobacco. Generous and round in the mouth, it has flavors of black cherry and pipe tobacco with an evenly weighted balance of velvety tannins and bright acidity.",91,55.0,Thracian Valley
67729,US,"A tiny production wine from a vineyard long farmed by the winemaker's parents, this is herbal, tannic and oaky at first, with waves of rose petal nipping on the nose. Integrated flavors of cherry and strawberry provide a bright overlay in balance with the moderate acidity and weight.",90,50.0,California
67730,Germany,"Whiffs of smoke and crushed stone on the nose of this off-dry Riesling foretell the intensely mineral nature of its palate. Sheer and spry, it's a delicately honeyed crush of bristling apple, lime and lemon flavors with a lingering mineral finish.",88,16.0,Mosel
67731,France,"This has a light herbaceous character followed by notes of warm yellow fruit, kiwi and bright acidity. It's crisp, fresh and ready to drink.",85,,Bordeaux
67732,US,"Just three barrels of this outstanding reserve were produced. It's full bodied, richly fruity and broadly textural, it holds its alcohol well, with strawberry jam highlighting a lush palate of ripe, sweet fruits. The barrel notes of toast, caramel and mocha are the frosting on the cake.",94,35.0,Washington
67733,Italy,"This has ripe black cherry and fig aromas accompanied by prune and black cherry flavors. It's simple but well made, and has nice freshness. It would pair seamlessly with ravioli stuffed with porcini mushrooms.",86,,Veneto
67734,Argentina,"Hard, oily, prickly and not impressive by global Sauvignon Blanc standards. The palate deals semisour grapefruit and passion fruit flavors, and the finish is a monotone continuation of the primary flavors.",81,10.0,Mendoza Province
67735,US,"Bright, ripe, seemingly sweet fruit fills the aromas and flavors of this soft and generous wine blended from Pinot Noir, Pinotage and Pinot Meunier grapes. It floods the palate with rich raspberry and black cherry notes. And since the tannins are very light and the acidity low, it has a pillowy texture.",88,25.0,California
67736,US,"Long Island is not typically known for Cabernet Sauvignon, but in the hands of winemaker Anthony Nappa (who also crafts excellent Cabs at Raphael), the variety shows remarkable promise. Juxtaposing heady notes of bramble and dried herb against a backdrop of luscious black currant and plum, this wild-fermented red is enticingly “savage” in style. Sharp cranberry notes and mineral tones lend edge to a lingering finish.",92,75.0,New York
67737,New Zealand,"Agressively pungent and herbal without being over the top, this is Sauvignon Blanc that screams of its origins. Grapefruit and passion fruit flavors wash easily across the palate, leaving plenty of grassy herbaceousness in their wake, and a crisp, lingering finish. Drink now.",91,15.0,Marlborough
67738,Argentina,"Stalky, baked aromas are bland. The wine feels tannic and scratchy, while flavors of generic berry fruits are herbal, reedy and wear a lot of cover-up oak. Minty, herbal notes drive the finish on this green-leaning Cab.",83,13.0,Mendoza Province
67739,US,"Too sweet and oaky, with sugary vanilla and pineapple jam flavors. Could be a Starbucks drink. Saved a bit by crisp acidity.",84,20.0,California
67740,France,"Although this wine has tannins, it's the fruit that shines, with its delicious black-currant flavor and acidity. It is more fine and elegant than it is powerful, a pleasant surprise from Saint-Estèphe in this vintage For medium-term aging.",93,,Bordeaux
67741,Spain,"Aromas of mineral and jammy raspberry are attractive, yet the palate seems a bit metallic and clicky, with hard to penetrate flavors of rooty fruits, vanilla, coconut and cola. Opens with airing to display secondary berry fruit flavors in front of a tough, firm finish. Nice and ripe, and ready to drink.",89,34.0,Catalonia
67742,US,"This blend of 57% Syrah, 35% Grenache, 6% Mourvèdre and 2% Cabernet Sauvignon shows black plums, roasted figs, cinnamon stick, uncrushed clove and star anise on the nose. That great nose doesn't translate yet to the palate, which is sticky with dark plum skin tannins, and proves a bit too leathery for drinking right now. Wait awhile and this one might work better.",85,19.0,California
67743,US,"Bone dry, this wine shows the soft, dusty tannins and herbal flavors that classically mark Alexander Valley Cabernet Sauvignon. It has an elegant structure housing flavors of blackberries, currants, sage, tobacco and cedar, and should develop in the bottle over the next 6–8 years.",87,70.0,California

67746,US,"The aromas of high-toned herbs, butter and toast seem to show some oxygen exposure, giving a latex-paint smell and leading to elegantly styled pineapple, kiwi and papaya flavors. It's tropical fruit in a glass.",85,18.0,Washington
67747,US,"Softly tannic, fully dry, and with a peppery edge, this is an elegant Cabernet ready to drink now with a good steak. It has a nice core of juicy blackberries, black cherries and cassis.",87,24.0,California
67748,US,"The fruity, jammy forwardness of this Pinot makes you think it will develop in the cellar, but it's a little too soft for extended aging. So give it a good decanting, and enjoy the raspberries, cherries and opulent new oak over the next year or two.",88,60.0,California
67749,New Zealand,"This Hawke's Bay-based producer has drawn fruit from Central Otago for this wine, which shows some austere tannins and minty overtones. Cherry and cinnamon notes join wintergreen, while the finish is clean, dry and firm. Worth holding a few years to see what develops.",87,35.0,Central Otago
67750,US,"There is a delicious, citrusy kick to this wine, lifting the bright berry fruit flavors. The flavors pile on, with peppery spice and chocolate, and a complex midpalate that tastes like cherry cola.",92,40.0,Oregon
67751,US,"Goldschmidt released their 2004 Vyborny Cab nearly 2 years ago, and it was terrific. This PLUS bottling has not been explained by the winery, but seems to be a reserve-style selection of the wine, and a lot oakier. The wine is extremely ripe in blackberries and cherries, while the oak adds sweeter vanilla and caramel flavors that do not really add to the original release.",91,120.0,California
67752,US,"Off-dry and fruity, this lively Riesling is notable for its strong honeysuckle scent and the follow-up flavors of lemon and honey. Its best flavors come on early; after a while it starts to recall a honey/lemon cough drop.",86,20.0,Oregon
67753,France,"Mineral and young, this tight, nervy wine needs to develop. Apple and pear flavors are ripe while also bringing out attractive acidity. The texture is still firm and steely, needing time. Drink from 2016.",89,29.0,Burgundy
67754,US,"A warm amber color and intense, concentrated honey and toasted-nut aromas are followed by a supple, soft texture and mouthcoating flavors of sweet apricot and baked peaches. This will be fantastic as a dessert in itself, or with some less-sweet cookies or sautéed almonds.",93,36.0,California
67755,US,"This offers strong oak and smoke aromas, plus ripe black cherry, chocolate and plum flavors. Full body and firm tannins make it assertive. Not a cocktail wine, this needs to pair with some heavy meat.",87,18.0,California
67756,US,"Plump aromas of white peach, lemon syrup, butterscotch and prominent oak show on the nose of this bottling, one of the richer ones in the current Talley lineup. The oak smoke flavors mix with vanilla and a finish of caramel on the palate, but the winery's reliably bright acidity hold the larger elements in check.",92,44.0,California

67759,Chile,"Fresh, floral raspberry and currant aromas are woody and spicy as they lead to a racy, balanced palate with good acidity but also a sense of oak resin. Raspberry, red currant and wood spice flavors see oak outlast fruit on the finish.",89,25.0,Aconcagua Costa
67760,Spain,"Fairly flat on the nose, and also innocuous on the palate. Flavors of green melon and nectarine are modest at best, and while the mouthfeel is decent, the overall character of the wine isn't that exciting. Finishes pithy, citric and mealy. Yet another mediocre Navarran Chardonnay.",83,13.0,Northern Spain
67761,Italy,"Scents of fresh red berry, violet and cake spice meld together in the glass. The vibrant, straightforward palate offers tart red cherry, orange rind and a hint of star anise alongside racy acidity and sleek tannins.",87,20.0,Tuscany
67762,US,"This is a thick, almost syrupy Riesling, packed with fruit flavors of peaches and apricots. It's tilting toward off dry, with residual sugar at 15 g/L, drinking well though somewhat one-dimensional.",86,13.0,Washington
67763,US,"There's a light whiff of nail polish remover here, and little evidence of ripe fruit. Some flavors of stem come up with the tannins, and overall this is a wine best drunk soon.",85,25.0,Oregon
67764,US,"Lively, enticing, this wine offers aromas and flavors of apples and pears and a smack of spice. The wine's elegant balance of fruit, sugar and acid gives it a food pairing advantage—partner it with everything from fresh grilled seafood to spicy ethnic cuisine. A lingering spicy finish seals the deal.",87,26.0,New York
67765,US,"This 100% varietal wine from the rocky, mountainous appellation offers sizable tannins and robust, smoky leather, black pepper and cola notes. Full-bodied and concentrated with ripe black fruit, it's a long, brawny experience.",91,95.0,California
67766,France,"Olivier Doujon made only 7,000 bottles of this 100% Merlot at the family estate in Fronsac. Rounded and ripe, this is a full-bodied wine with great fruitiness and attractive acidity. Well balanced, it offers red-cherry flavors with an edge of pepper. Drink the wine now.",88,13.0,Bordeaux
67767,US,"Just beautiful and oh, so refreshing. The cool vintage has resulted in a high-acid wine of enormous fruit, bursting with intense, classic Edna Valley flavors of limes, kiwis, Meyer lemons, honeysuckle and minerals. The vanilla spice and creamy smoke have got to come from the terroir, because the wine never saw a splinter of oak.",90,17.0,California
67768,US,"A little soft in acidity, in the way of Paso wines, but with just-in-time zest and tannins that give the flavors some structure. Mainly Cabernet Sauvignon, with 14% Petit Verdot, the wine is dry and rich, with blackberry, currant, cola, dark chocolate, violet, anise and cedar flavors. One of the more complex Bordeaux-style wines from this area. Drink now.",92,49.0,California
67769,Italy,"A concentrated, inky black wine with woodshop tones that are still very evident.

Drink from 2020.",94,109.0,Bordeaux
67772,US,"This late release is an unusual blend of Syrah, Baco Noir, Tempranillo and Dolcetto. All are strengths of the AVA, though rarely blended together. The extra bottle age has smoothed the rough edges, yielding a pleasant-drinking wine with flavors of strawberry preserves, citrus peel, and a touch of malt powder.",88,30.0,Oregon
67773,Chile,"Bright in color but that's where the excitement ends. The nose has plum, cherry and nail polish aromas, while the palate is sour, sheer, overly acidic and tartaric to the max. Way too sour and sharp.",81,9.0,Maule Valley

67777,US,"This wine is so ripe, rich and generous in flavor it's almost jammy, but there's no denying the appeal of all that fruitiness. Full body, velvety texture and soft acidity make it plush on the palate, helping the rich finish linger. Although it was aged in French barriques—two-thirds new—it's by no means an overoaked wine.",92,60.0,California
67778,US,"Showing just a touch of reduction, this wine is bright, crunchy and explosive on the palate. The palate shows a mix of raspberry, cherry and cranberry that's full of flavor. Seductively smooth, it should continue to evolve and expand with time, as the wine is just beginning to unravel its complex notes of baking spice, vanilla and tea.",93,72.0,California
67779,US,"This faint, elusive wine takes lightness and low alcohol to pronounced levels, offering intense lemon and Asian pear around a tight core of acidity. From the Pratt Vineyard, it spent time aging in both new air-dried Vosges oak barrels and small stainless steel.",88,35.0,California
67780,US,"Muddled blackberry and plum give this 70% Cabernet Sauvignon a warmth and complexity, accented by clove and herb.

67783,New Zealand,"Smoky and fruity upfront, reminiscent of wood-grilled white peaches, but tinged with hints of toasted hazelnut and pineapple as well. This is full-bodied yet reined in by the intense, citrus-zest finish. Drink it over the next 5–7 years.",92,42.0,Kumeu
67784,Italy,"Aromas of blue flowers, dried aromatic herbs and dark-skinned berry lead the nose.

67786,France,"Élevage in one-third new oak has imparted toast, vanilla and cedar aromas and given the texture of this wine a plush edge, but the quality of the underlying fruit and the length of the finish are undeniable.

67790,US,"Wattle Creek has done a good job with Cabernet over the years, and here's another one. I don't think '04 was their best vintage, as the wine is a little raisiny, despite an official alcohol of only 14.1%. But it shows a classy structure, polished dryness and a good depth of varietal black currant fruit, accented with new oak. Probably best now and for a few years.",87,50.0,California

67792,France,"This smoky wine has firm tannins and a tough core. The juicy fruit is taking its time to develop, although it will give the wine density and ripe berries in time. The vineyard, created in the early 1980s is now at peak maturity. Drink from 2017.",87,18.0,Bordeaux

67794,France,"Scented red apple and tart red berries cast a summer spell. On the palate, the fruit flavors are expressed gently and with ease, riding on the foamy froth and a very light, easygoing body. The finish is mouthwatering, moreish, dry and totally appetizing.",89,17.0,Alsace

67803,US,"Adelsheim helped to pioneer Dijon clone Chardonnay in Oregon, a movement that completely reshaped and reinvigorated those wines.

67804,Argentina,"Mildly pickled red-fruit aromas fail to convey freshness or ripeness, and so it's no surprise that the core flavors are a bit herbal and briney. Decent mouthfeel helps it along, while the finish is short and borders on medicinal.",83,12.0,Mendoza Province

67816,US,"This is a gorgeous Cabernet, but it's pretty young, and while it's delicious now due to the ripe fruit, it really needs time. Wrapped in fresh, tight tannins, it displays powerful red and black currant, blackberry, cherry, chocolate and vanilla oak flavors, and shows the elegant, important mouthfeel of a top Napa Cab.

67820,France,"In this great year for white Burgundy, Bâtard-Montrachet shines out as the epitome of balance between superb fruit and intense mineral and terroir characters.

67826,Chile,"This Cab-Carmenère blend's more of the olive-earth-tree-bark kind than the blackberry-and-oak variety; still, there's enough black berry fruit underneath the outdoorsy aromas and flavors. Finishes with lots of green herb, and a vegetal note.",84,17.0,Maipo Valley
67827,US,"This is a very ripe and rather oaky Chardonnay that shows off how well the vintage perfected the grapes. Brims with smoky flavors of pineapple custard, Meyer lemon pie filling, butterscotch and cinnamon spices. Calls for rich fare, such as scallops.",87,32.0,California
67828,US,"While Cabernet Sauvignon dominant, all five red Bordeaux varieties are represented here. Dark in color, a combination of black pepper and black-fruit syrup meets earthy and dry tannins. This structured wine needs time. Cellar through 2020.",90,30.0,California

This young wine should do interesting things.",89,49.0,California

67909,US,"This six-year-old wine is 40% Tempranillo, 40% Carmenère and 20% Cabernet Sauvignon. The Carmenère dominates, pushing stiff, tannic, stemmy flavors into the core. It's not in danger of aging too quickly, but the tannins seem unlikely to soften.",85,32.0,Oregon

67915,New Zealand,"Possibly just in a sullen phase, this reserve bottling from Craggy's home vineyard is dominated for the moment by smoke and cedar on the nose, and while there is some cherry fruit apparent in the mouth, it doesn't appear to be fully expressing itself.

Good but struggles to find a pleasurable sweet spot.",86,39.0,Other

Lovely, inviting aromas mix roses and rocks, leading into fresh, layered, complex fruit flavors of pear, apple, white peach and orange.

68121,US,"Yellow rose, honey-glazed almond, tangerine peel and beeswax aromas combine for a complex nose in this bottling from a new label. It's quite dry and tightly wound on the palate, where waxy flavors of sour orange, lemon spritz and grapefruit peel leave a bittersweet impression, finishing with a hint of petrol.",88,40.0,California
68122,France,"Crisp and tangy, this is a tightly knit wine. Apples and crisp citrus flavors are part of a package that also includes spice, a strong minerality and a perfumed aftertaste.

68125,US,"Tingly acidity complements the lush, full-bodied concentration of this estate-grown beauty. It's both soft and sensual in tone. Pine, orange peel and pomegranate notes play against the richness and add freshness to the chewy tannin. Best enjoyed 2024 through 2034.",94,90.0,California
68126,France,"A smooth, rich wine, it is just losing its flavors of wood aging and developing its black fruit flavors to show the opulence of the vintage. Structure and a solid texture frame the ripe fruit. It could still age, so wait until 2015.",89,75.0,Bordeaux
68127,France,This is an unusual rosé for Champagne. It is made 100% from Pinot Noir rather than a blend. And it is made by getting color directly from the fermenting grapes rather than the normal Champagne process of adding red wine. The result is a dark-colored rosé that has a tannic structure as well as red fruits. It is rich and concentrated with ripeness rather than great freshness. It is definitely a food wine.,87,40.0,Champagne
68128,Australia,"Made in the winery's classically savory style, this flagship Cabernet shows a touch of bricking at the rim and some maturing aromas and flavors of tobacco, cedar and earth.

68132,France,"This is a rare red wine in this Loir Valley appellation, wood aged and rich.

68133,US,"Tasted in early spring, this Chard was still tingly with acidity, but by the time you read this, everything should have calmed down. It's terrifically ripe with green apple, nectarine and tropical fruit flavors that are so rich, you won't even miss the oak.",90,37.0,California

68137,US,"Bigger, bolder swathes of fresh grapefruit, gooseberry and citrus distinguish the Katherine's Field from it's sister bottling, the Life Force. Fermented in stainless steel, it's a more primary, forward expression of fruit but with an equally refreshing backbone of acidity. Hints of dusty oyster shell and lime pith lend nuance to the finish. Drink now through 2019.",89,24.0,New York
68138,South Africa,"Cocoa dusted black raspberry, black currant and plum aromas up front transition to flavors of blackberry and fudgy brownie.

68140,US,"This Provençal-style blush is made from Syrah, Mourvèdre and Grenache. It's a good wine, dry and crisply acidic, but not without its faults. The main problem is a streak of green mint and vegetables. But there's enough sweet raspberry and cherry fruit to get by.",85,24.0,California
68141,Spain,"Really good and interesting Syrah, with chocolate, campfire, menthol and prune on the nose. With airing the wine quickly settles into a deep, smooth berry and chocolate groove, while the finish deals pure tannins and comfort.

68143,US,"This is a sultry, sexy wine—elegant in red fruit and black licorice, with a restrained approach to both tannin and oak. From a mountain vineyard, this has a complex mix of aromas, from pine and forest floor to brambly wild berry. Full bodied and voluptuous on the palate, it remains balanced and pretty.

68145,US,"Napa Cabernets of this explosive power have the challenge of maintaining balance under the assault of all that fruit. This wine, fortunately, succeeds. It does offer an explosion of blackberries, currants, cassis and mocha, but is grounded by a savory olive notes and minerality. Meanwhile, the tannin-acid balance is near perfect. It will be hard to keep your hands off it until 2020, but try.",94,80.0,California
68146,Italy,There's a spicy element of clove or cinnamon (25% of the wine is aged in oak) that is followed by stone fruit and bitter almond. Tonic effervescence and crisp acidity would help pair this wine with quiche.,87,20.0,Lombardy
68147,France,"The wood aging shows in this wine, giving a smoky, spicy character. It has softened the crisp fruits and allowed the wine to broaden out with ripe berry fruits. Solid and dense, it will need to age so drink from 2017.",87,15.0,Bordeaux
68148,US,"A very rich Bordeaux blend based on Cabernet Sauvignon, but quite tannic. You want to give it some time in the cellar.

Give it until 2012 to come around.",93,55.0,California

68150,South Africa,"Winemaker: Kevin Arnold. A Bordeaux-style blend of 70% Cabernet Sauvignon, 23% Cabernet Franc and 7% Petit Verdot, this is quite toasty and spicy upfront, with pronounced notes of baked mulberry, boysenberry and cassis that are dusted by earthy, rooty tree bark and woodspice. More ripe fruit flavors, medium-plus tannins and ample acidity result in a crushed-satin texture, finishing long and dry. Drink now–2024.",91,,Stellenbosch

68152,Italy,"Bright and delicious, this starts with aromas of blue flower, red berries, mint and thyme together with a whiff of leather.

68157,US,"From Heidi Barrett's estate vineyard in Calistoga, this Syrah is very rich and appealing.

68163,US,"Fresh and stony on the nose, this bottling from one of the region's leading properties shows crisp lime and grapefruit pith aromas.

68180,US,"This wine is a big one, going all out to make friends.

68183,US,"As with the other single-vineyard wines from Brooks, this was give 18 months in French oak, and shows strong accents of baking spices and plum cake.

68194,Chile,"Chunky and pasty-smelling, with a thick set of berry aromas that rest heavily in the glass. Not very fruity but definitely herbal.

68201,US,"Along with a fascinating nose, this bottling from the appellation's westernmost vineyard offers the rounded ripeness of cherimoya, nectarine and white peach but with a laser-sharp line of crushed sea shell and flint minerality alongside scratched lemon skin.

68227,US,"This starts out well, with some varietal fruit and pepper in the nose. But the aggressive vanilla and coffee flavors suggest that the oak treatments were not well integrated, and the tannins have a bitterly harsh edge to them.",82,19.0,Washington
68228,New Zealand,"Slightly herbal in style, with hints of tomato leaf accenting black cherry fruit. This is a crisp, fresh—even tangy—red that perhaps needs a few months to settle down and smooth out. Try it later this year; it should cellar well through 2018.",87,30.0,Marlborough
68229,New Zealand,"Think Crozes-Hermitage and you'll have a reasonable idea of what this wine is about: White pepper and cherry aromas and flavors, medium body without being overly rich or textured and a crisp, peppery finish. Drink it over the next couple of years with burgers and the like.",87,16.0,Hawke's Bay
68230,Chile,"An odd mix of Graham cracker, blueberry jam and floral aromas yield a kitchen cleanser whole. With time things get better, yielding a big, sticky palate of blueberry, blackberry and syrupy flavors. A grapey big boy with a cloying finish. Good but not balanced quite right.",85,50.0,Cachapoal Valley
68231,France,"Made from grapes sourced from Domaines Devillard's 12 acres of premier cru Mercurey vineyards, this rich, weighty wine has ripe red fruits that are layered with new wood and tannins. A structured effort that's meant to age for five years and more.",90,68.0,Burgundy
68232,US,"A terrific Pinot, wonderful for drinking now, and should develop some bottle complexity over the next 5–6 years. Really shows off that flashy Bien Nacido character, offering wildly rich cherry and persimmon flavors, balanced with brisk acidity and a dusting of fuzzy tannins.",93,45.0,California

68239,US,"All six Bordeaux varieties are incorporated here, half being Cabernet Sauvignon from Walla Walla's Pepperbridge vineyard.

68241,France,"This blanc de blancs, fermented and aged in wood, is a fine Champagne. Its mineral texture and light oxidative character from the use of wood is contrasted with the tight citrus fruitiness and nervy steely texture. The wine is just mature although still with plenty of fruit. Drink now.",93,50.0,Champagne
68242,US,Crisp acidity gives this off-dry Riesling just the edge of tartness it needs to balance out the sweet citrus and flower flavors. It's the perfect inexpensive summer picnic white wine.,85,9.0,California

68249,France,"The little touch of wood aging (three months) is just enough to round out the Chardonnay. At the same time, it does show freshness and apple flavors, with an attractive floral character. It is soft and finally ripe.",88,14.0,Southwest France

68253,France,"This 90-acre vineyard has produced an attractive, light wine. Fruity with red-berry flavors, it is already soft and fresh. Acidity and touches of tannin are balanced enough for the wine to be ready to drink.",85,29.0,Bordeaux

68256,US,"Aromatic with soda pop scents of Dr. Pepper, cola and root beer, this is nonetheless a reasonably substantial wine, not a simple fruit bomb. It's lively and full of interesting flavors that suggest herb, root and spice; the wood remains a background flavor.",88,43.0,Oregon
68257,France,"A beautifully crafted wine that has both richness and sweetness. It brings together the fresh character of 2006 with more powerful elements, such as new wood and spice, enveloped plushly with ripe fruit. The tannins have a dark element, but fit well with the sweet fruit. All in all, a delicious wine that also has aging potential.",93,,Bordeaux
68258,US,"Fresh and crisp on the nose, this lively and laser-sharp wine shows grapefruit skin and pith, Gala apple and cut grass scents on the nose. That grassy element grows more prevalent on the sip, accenting tarter lime peel flavors.",88,26.0,California
68259,US,"This is a rather light wine in both density, flavor and impact. Some dilute citrus fruit flavors are framed with the lightest hint of cracker. Drink it chilled or use it as a mixer.",85,10.0,Washington
68260,France,"A blend of different parcels in Puligny-Montrachet, this creamy wine shows a medley of ripe fruit flavors, both yellow and tropical, and subtle toast from wood aging. Juicy acidity cuts through its richness, leading into a full aftertaste. Drink from 2018.",90,,Burgundy

68262,US,"A firm, full, distinctive Pinot Noir, from an organic vineyard in the Dundee Hills. Light fruit flavors of berry play second fiddle to notes of earth and clay, and drying tannins. The wine surprises with its length; it extends into a finish that continues to hold your attention and its focus, for a minute or more.",90,28.0,Oregon
68263,US,"With its flavors of raspberry and cherry soda, this a simple Pinot Noir. A slight grassy note comes through on the finish.",85,16.0,Oregon
68264,Chile,"Pinched and sharp on the nose, this has nettle and citrus aromas that are more typical of Sauvignon Blanc than of Chardonnay. It feels juicy and acidic, with passion fruit, grapefruit and lasting citrus flavors. It's fresh and racy, but it's varietally confusing.",82,11.0,Casablanca Valley
68265,US,"The Cabernet Sauvignon grape really comes through on this rosé from Paso Robles pioneer Justin. There is strawberry shortcake at first, but the Cab's capacin-led aromas of green bell pepper are prominent. The pepper carries through to the palate, in a very intriguing, tasty way, offering balance between berry fruit and green bitterness.",87,20.0,California

68269,US,"A bright cherry-red color, this lively, sweet-scented wine proves that Oregon can still make a Pinot Noir in a lighter style without having it turn vegetal. Despite a citrusy snap to the palate, it feels smooth and even a bit satiny, and the pretty cranberry/cherry fruit is annotated with cinnamon and light toast. A superb value.",87,14.0,Oregon
68270,Italy,"Made with 65% Sangiovese, 20% Merlot and 15% Cabernet Sauvignon, this has subtle aromas of black-skinned fruit and thyme. The easygoing palate delivers black cherry and cinnamon alongside smooth tannins.",87,16.0,Tuscany
68271,US,"A lightly textured wine that suggests lemon chiffon, this has plenty of body to make it feel rich on the palate, along with ample acidity to keep it refreshingly crisp. Apple and pear rise to the fore, maintaining the fruitiness from start to finish.",90,30.0,California
68272,US,"The blend is largely Merlot, with splashes of Syrah, Cabernet Sauvignon and Petit Verdot. There is a strong scent of vanilla that only partially masks the flavors of leaf and stem. Tannic and a bit earthy, this would be a good wine to pair with a red pasta sauce.",86,17.0,Washington
68273,US,"Hall, which has gotten huge scores over the years, now has this Mount Veeder bottling, but the warning is that they're playing with fire. It's so massive in fruit, it risks being ridiculed as a bombastic pop wine. There's no denying the power of the blackberries, currants, chocolate and oak, but there's a case to be made for elegance and restraint. Easily earns its high score, but the hope is that the winemaker will be mindful with future releases.",93,145.0,California
68274,US,"An unfortunate green, vegetal streak cuts through the heart of this Pinot Noir. It blurs the cherry fruit and detracts from the fine silky texture.",82,40.0,California
68275,Italy,"A delightful wine, with violet and berry aromas followed by bright, crunchy red-fruit flavors. A hint of nutmeg adds interest to the palate. This is simple, but well made and fresh. Pair it with pizza or pasta.",87,13.0,Tuscany
68276,US,"The deep black color of this wine suggests that it spent a lot of time on the skins, and 20 months in American oak added further grip and grit to the tannins. Cherry tobacco, espresso and plenty of oak flavors lead into a chewy finish with some residual bitterness.",86,45.0,Oregon
68277,US,"A distinctive aroma like ripe peaches and fennel and full, almost sweet fruit and spice flavors give this medium-bodied wine personality. The texture is soft and luscious rather than lively, and practically coats the mouth from sip to sip.",88,18.0,California
68278,France,"Totally grassy and herbaceous, this green, crisp wine also has a more serious, ageworthy side. There is a firm minerality here, along with a nervy, tense character that will allow it to mature. Drink from 2016.",88,45.0,Loire Valley
68279,New Zealand,"In marginal climates, what a difference a vintage can make. The 2015s from proprietor Sam Neill (yes, the actor) are a big step up from the 2014s. This bottling, from the Bannockburn subregion, offers bold notes of black cherries, plum and cola. It's a rich, ripe and powerful wine, with a long, intense finish that bodes well for cellaring. Drink now–2025.",92,79.0,Central Otago
68280,US,"This is a vibrant, lush and layered Cabernet- Sauvignon-dominated blend, with smaller percentages of Merlot, Malbec, Petit Verdot and Cabernet Franc.

Lay it down for a special occasion many years from now.",94,145.0,California
68281,France,"The dominance of Cabernet Sauvignon in the blend of this structured wine gives strong tannins and tight black currant fruit at this young stage. It has good potential, however, a solid and powerful wine that needs several years. Drink from 2018.",88,38.0,Bordeaux
68282,Chile,"Aromas of bacon, road tar, spices and smoke lend masculinity and confidence to herbal berry-fruit notes. This feels fresh, a touch wiry and deep.

68283,US,"Somewhat disjointed, this watery effort hints at berry flavors, with a bit of road tar and cola.",84,20.0,Oregon
68284,US,"The tannins give this wine a lockdown feeling, making it hard and astringent. But the fruit is strong and jammy, suggesting raspberries, cherries and blackberries. Made from Syrah, Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot, it's forward and one-dimensional now, but delicious, and unlikely to improve with age.",88,40.0,California

68286,US,"A good, useful Cabernet, made for balance in large quantities from vineyards up and down the valley. It's dry, tannic and complex in blackberry, black currant, herb and new oak flavors. Drinking well now. Production was 17,843 cases.",87,38.0,California
68287,Israel,"Offering aromas of blackberry, strawberry and green bell pepper, this wine has flavors of raspberry, strawberry, black cherry and leather. The fruit flavors are jammy on the palate and strong tannins and equally strong acidity make for a pleasing wine.",88,9.0,Israel
68288,US,"An awesome Pinot Noir—it's hard to find words to describe its beauty. It's bone dry and rich in stimulating acidity, and the cherry and raspberry fruit flavors have an earthy, mushroomy quality that grounds the wine and gives it a real sense of terroir. Shows the fleshy attractions of the amazing '07 vintage, with an undisputed capacity to age. Now–2017, at least.",97,52.0,California
68289,US,"This is dry, tart in acidity and stimulating in lemongrass and pear flavors. It has a touch of New Zealand-style gooseberry, demonstrating a green-peppercorn-like grassiness. Try pairing it with a goat cheese and thyme omelet for weekend brunch.",88,13.0,California

68291,US,"A riot of licorice, cassis, toast and berry, this 83% Cabernet Sauvignon/17% Petit Verdot Bordeaux-style blend is currently showing a lot of barrel flavors, with subdued but not insignificant fruit. Medium-grained tannins give the finish some gravitas.",90,58.0,Washington

68293,France,"From Barton & Guestier's own chateau, the wine is a well-balanced spice- and berry fruit-flavored wine. Its tannins fit with the fresh 2008 acidity and lively, fruity character. Age for 2–3 years.",88,20.0,Bordeaux
68294,France,"This wine is dense, although you hardly notice the tannins for the weight of concentrated fruit. The tannins are there, though, a power to thrust this immense wine well into the future. It is well formed, firm while rich. Drink from 2024.",96,530.0,Burgundy
68295,France,"This is a soft and juicy wine with black currant fruitiness. Its wood aging is nicely judged, allowing its ripe character, acidity and black fruit to show through. The wine will be ready to drink from 2019.",88,21.0,Bordeaux
68296,US,"This is a compelling wine with aromas of coffee, dried herbs, cherry and barrel spices. It wins over on finesse rather than power but shows more than ample amounts of both. There's enough structure that it will benefit from some time in the cellar. It will be best from 2019–2027.",93,99.0,Washington

68312,US,"A very light shade of hay in the glass, this bottling, which is rounded by 16% Sémillon, shows poached pear, honeysuckle nectar, green plum and lime skin on the nose.

68339,US,"Delicious in pastry-filling raspberry and cherry flavors, with a baked brown sugar richness and exotic touches of vanilla, cinnamon, anise and toast.

68340,US,"Merlot comprises 53% of the blend, Cabernet Sauvignon 40%, and Cab Franc fills in the final 7%. Well built and satisfyingly complete, this tribute to grower Dick Boushey uses fruit from his oldest (25-year) vines.

It's a big, bold wine that segues neatly into a finish of chocolate and butterscotch.",91,50.0,Washington
68341,Chile,"Dense, baked and mulled blackberry and cassis aromas include bold but classy oak notes.

68343,Spain,"Gritty, reedy, minty aromas overshadow this Tempranillo blend's hollow berry scents. Hard, tannic and drawn in, this wine tastes of rustic plum and berry fruits along with hard spices. Notes of tomato, green herbs and raw tannins create a rugged finish.",87,19.0,Northern Spain
68344,Austria,"Some earthy spice mingles with the citrus zest that does not want to reveal itself quite yet, but there are notions of citron and grapefruit peel.

Light-bodied but rather seductive with an intensity that slowly creeps up on you.",94,75.0,Wachau

It displays its youth through assertive tannins and oak-derived scents, layering the thick finish with cinnamon bark.",91,50.0,California
68349,US,"This is 80% Cabernet Sauvignon blended with 16% Merlot and 4% Cabernet Franc.

The mid-palate still needs some time to fully come together but when it does, it will be a beauty.",91,40.0,Washington

68361,US,"This is Swanson's top Cabernet, which includes a splash of Merlot. As always, it's rich, tannic and dry, and it possesses a deep core of blackberry and black currant flavors. It seems more tannic and sharp than in previous vintages, which suggests its ageability. Try holding it until 2015.",90,75.0,California

68363,Austria,"Grapefruit zest and chervil meet in a happy union that suggests riper fruit the longer this stays on the palate.

Intense, concentrated and age-worthy, with a lasting citrus finish.",92,48.0,Südsteiermark
68364,France,"The senses are immediately captured by the purity of the perfectly ripe apple notes that rise from the glass. The palate continues in that pure, joyous, juicy vein.

That structure will help the wine age well, allowing the rather intense flavors to mellow and evolve. Best after 2021.",92,36.0,California
68368,France,"The nose is reminiscent of the yellow and aromatic peel of ripe apples. It even has a touch of mirabelle. The palate continues in the same fruit-driven vein with that pure, ripe but tart apple note that seems to be such a feature of Alsace Riesling. The palate is dry and has a fine-boned structure that almost crunches in the mouth. A pure lemon note makes for a very clean-cut finish.",94,53.0,Alsace

68371,France,"While rich, this blend of Syrah and Cabernet Sauvignon is also quite herbal in character. Maybe it gets its nature from the wild garrigue countryside of Provence, but its tannins are firm and the fruit is laced with licorice. It should age another year.",87,30.0,Provence
68372,US,"This wine is a blend of all six Bordeaux varieties: 35% Merlot, 30% Cabernet Sauvignon, 25% Cabernet Franc, 4% Carménère, 3% Malbec and 3% Petit Verdot.

68376,France,"The wine is still young, with a dense and full-bodied series of flavors that are still developing. As it matures the ripe yellow fruits will come through strongly, assisted by the citrus zest and contrasting with the tight, nervy texture. Expect the wine to be ready in 2016.",90,40.0,Burgundy
68377,US,"A really good wine for the price, this offers a dark color and varietal aromas of black cherry, black olive and faint dried herbs. Next it layers handsome oak on the rich and fruity flavors. The texture is quite dense without being heavy; while somewhat tannic the mouthfeel is not drying.",88,10.0,California
68378,US,"This Rhône-leaning kitchen-sink blend of Grenache, Petite Sirah, Mourvèdre, Alicante Bouschet, Syrah, Nebbiolo, Zinfandel, Touriga Nacional and Merlot shows red currant, blackberry and vanilla on the nose.

68379,US,"A fancy Syrah, dry, complex and interesting to drink. It packs in a lot of blackberry and cherry fruit flavors, accented with a sweet jacket of smoky oak. The alcohol is a bit high, resulting in some heat. Drink soon.",90,28.0,California
68380,US,"This Pinot is made in a lighter style, but it's complex and interesting. It's marked by dryness and acidic crispness. The raspberry, cola and persimmon flavors are enriched with a touch of sweet, smoky oak. Seems best now, but it could surprise over the next six years.",91,39.0,California
68381,France,"Owned since 1999 by the Kressman family of Latour-Martillac in Pessac-Léognan, this wine reflects fine winemaking thanks to its ripe tannins and the fruitiness of the vintage.

68389,US,"The aromas come off as quite green, with notes of bell pepper and garden herbs more reminiscent of a Cabernet Franc. The flavors are elegant and show more of the same. It's an exploration of Cabernet's greener side, surprising considering the warmer vintage and region.",87,36.0,Washington
68390,US,"Nine Hats is a recently-introduced second wine from Long Shadows. Clearly this is great juice, though it is, inevitably, a bit of a mishmash blend. Tannins are a little rough, but as a $25 red this has plenty of high-priced flavor.",90,25.0,Washington
68391,US,"Juicy and supple, this wine astounds with its ability to be generously broad in appeal yet with undeniable complexity and tension.

68392,New Zealand,"This dark-fruited Pinot Noir is sturdily constructed yet never seems hard or tough, thanks to the silkiness of its plentiful tannins. Black cherry fruit picks up shadings of mocha on the dusty finish. Drink 2015–2020.",90,30.0,Central Otago

68397,US,"The slow-growing trend of white Pinot Noir finally landed on the Central Coast and Coby Parker-Garcia gives it a compelling argument in this bottling. Quite clear in the glass, and maybe the slightest bit pink, this shows crisp and clear aromas of orange blossoms, poached pear, sliced lime and rainy cement. The palate is tightly wound with fresh flavors of honeysuckle and more orange blossom.",90,30.0,California

68403,US,"A strong and tasty oak component makes this full-bodied wine an attention-grabber, beginning with the toasted aromas, then complex and spicy flavors and firmly tannic texture. While the oakiness tamps down the fruit flavors, it does make it fun to drink.",88,20.0,California
68404,France,"Rich and fruity, this is a balanced, mainly Merlot wine with some good tannins and a dark berry fruitiness. It is still young and full of dryness, although this will fill out.

The juice is a little overpowered, though the acids punch through with some tart raspberry fruit.",89,32.0,Washington

68410,Canada,"Shows pronounced oily, earthy, almost tobacco-like elements to its bouquet; also honey and clementines.  Not overly rich, but flavorful and complete, with excellent balance.  Like the other Colio Estate wines, this emphasizes subtle earth shadings over slap-you-in-the-face-fruit.",90,,Ontario
68411,US,"Columbia's second-tier Syrah uses Red Willow fruit from young plantings. The wine has a lovely black-plum color, and it's softly scented with chocolate, pepper and berries. Youthful, vibrant and sharp-toned, with the tart fruit cloaked in smooth, chocolaty tannins.",88,15.0,Washington

68553,France,"One of a pair of blanc de blancs from grand cru vineyards, this is a chalky, flinty-textured wine. It is crisp and tight, still young and needing to age.

68557,US,"A clean, brisk Chardonnay made from this small, cool part of Monterey County's Salinas Valley.

68563,US,"From grapes grown at some of the Willamette Valley's highest elevations, this is a pungent mix of citrus oil, grapefruit, metal shavings and stone.

68566,Italy,"Intensely fragrant, this opens with aromas of chopped mint, baking spice, pressed violet and cedar. The linear, elegant palate delivers tart red cherry, crushed red raspberry, clove, star anise and mineral alongside assertive, fine-grained tannins and fresh acidity.

68567,US,"This is a strikingly pure expression of single-vineyard, Red Mountain Cabernet Sauvignon. Focused and tight, it is extremely dense and textural, with a mix of cassis and coffee.

68568,US,"This is another of the producer's intellectual exercises in experimental winemaking, made in tiny case-production numbers.

68575,US,"This is a great vineyard that has sourced great Cabs for Terra Valentine. A barrel sample of the '04, tasted more than 2 years ago, showed ageability. Now that it has been released, the wine is still very young and filled with potential. Thick in black currants, cherries and oak, it needs much more time. Best after 2010.",92,58.0,California
68576,France,"Made from 50% Syrah and 50% Mourvèdre, this rosé offers direct notes of red cherry, currant and raspberry on the nose and mouth. Hints of savory herbs and underbrush add depth to the palate, finishing short and slightly bitter. Drink up.",84,15.0,Languedoc-Roussillon
68577,US,"The slightest hint of pale pink-orange in the glass, this late disgorged sparkler shows steel, lightly chilled dough yeast, lemon chiffon, crisp nectarine and an alkaline element on the nose.

68578,Italy,"From what may well be the most beautiful vineyard in Italy comes this gorgeous expression of elegance and power. Guardiola is a tiny plot on the slopes of Mount Etna with blackened soils, majestic fruit trees and religious shrines peppered between a jungle of gnarled grapevines.

68579,US,"Tasted in February, 2014, this Pinot was showing a slight effervescence, not unpleasant, but considered a flaw. The spritziness might calm down with a few more months in the bottle.

68581,Argentina,"Aromas of mealy apple and citrus are less than inviting, while the palate is citrusy but lacking in true Chardonnay character; instead it shows odd flavors of ham and orange juice. Ranks as yet another uninspired Argentine Chard in a long line of such wines.",83,12.0,Mendoza Province
68582,Argentina,"Tropical fruit aromas are the lead-in, but upon airing the wine's pineapple and mango scents turn austere and prickly. The mouthfeel here is astringent and acidic, and the flavors are briny, even pickled.",82,17.0,Other
68583,France,"After a touch of funky reduction, beautiful hints of herbs appear: yarrow and lemon balm play alongside lemon and crisp green-apple aromas. On the palate, these notions all remain taut along a very linear, slender but concentrated body that owes more to citrus than to apples. There is a powerful enduring core of fruit and stone that will make this last. The flavors echo long and leave the mouth totally clean. Drink now through 2035.",95,44.0,Alsace
68584,France,"Mint aromas and new wood flavors mark this smoothly ripe, polished wine. It has a good amount of black fruit, a dry but open texture and a rich, smoky character. The tannins and generous fruit power the wine forward.",91,20.0,Bordeaux
68585,France,Organically grown grapes are the source of this wine that comes from selected parcels on the Domaine de Rochoy. Flint soil gives a strongly mineral character that permeates the wine. The tight and steely texture contrasts happily with the sliced apple and lemon flavors. It needs to age for several more months. Drink from late 2017.,93,40.0,Loire Valley
68586,France,"This is a serious wine, with its mineral texture and tangy structure. It has plenty of apple and zingy orange flavors. But the main thrust at this stage is of a wine poised for considerable aging. Fresh and still tight, it needs several years. Drink from 2018.",93,70.0,Champagne
68587,US,"Oak aromas are at the fore, with notes of vanilla, toffee, barrel spice and char followed by game and red fruit.

It's a surprisingly elegant wine considering the appellation.",87,30.0,Washington
68588,US,"Block 8 is pure Wädenswil clone, displaying peppery brambly berry flavors and plenty of underbrush. The acids are sharp and bring suggestions of oranges and other citrus.

68601,US,"Winemaker Mike Lee continues to prove his prowess with Sauvignon Blanc in this latest vintage of Patianna, Patti Fetzer's line of organically farmed wines from outside of Hopland in Mendocino County.

68603,US,"Outstanding. Almost equal parts Cab and Merlot, this wine is immature now, all primary cherry and currant fruit, unintegrated oak and chunky tannins.

68604,Germany,"In contrast to a nose that's more mineral than fruit, the intensity of this wine's voluptuous nectarine and yellow peach flavors surprise.

68609,South Africa,"Winemaker: Andries Burger. An attractive and varietally correct Pinot, this leads with aromas of ripe red cherry, currant and strawberry fruits, all laced with hints of bittersweet cocoa, cola spice and sous bois. Silky in texture, with smooth tannins and ample acidity to keep the red fruit flavors fresh and lively on the palate. The finish transitions from just-ripe cherry to sweet spice and finally forest floor, with just a hint of savory mushroom on the very end.

It's subdued in its elegance, but should become more profound by holding until 2020–2022 for maturation.",90,42.0,Mosel
68672,US,"This is a fabulous example of a light, balanced wine from the Santa Lucia Highlands, which is perhaps better known for richness.

68770,France,"The 60% Cabernet in the blend gives a dark fruit character. At this young stage, the wood aging still dominates with its burnt toast and chocolate character. For the future, while the wine will be dry, it also has plenty of fresh fruit. Drink from 2018.",87,,Bordeaux

68777,US,"Cinnabar produced this wine and has held it back longer than most other wineries. As a result, the 100% Cabernet has achieved a velvety softness, making it immediately drinkable. It has pretty flavors of cherries, black raspberries, chocolate and smoky oak.",92,45.0,California
68778,France,"Subdued, riper fruit has not yet come to the surface. Notions of Bramley apple are evoked on the nose; on the palate they show as the more rounded flavor of baked Bramley. Hovering above it all is grated lemon zest, pulling fruit, texture and freshness tautly together in a dry, fresh yet mellow finish. The more you taste, the more the still-underlying fruit yearns to rise to the surface. Best to give this some time so it can show its true, exciting colours.",93,24.0,Alsace

68783,US,"Awesomely rich in fruit as well as oak, this wine is almost too much of a good thing. But there's plenty of acidity for balance, and enough minerallity and earthiness to ground the massive cherry, raspberry and strawberry flavors. Delicious now, and should evolve well over the next five years.",92,50.0,California
68784,France,"Vines planted on steep, terraced slopes around an 18th-century château give a dense and warm wine. While the acidity is very present, bringing out lemon and orange flavors, the spice and pepper give the wine its complexity and its still-young aftertaste. Drink from 2016.",91,,Provence

68788,US,"This is delicious now for its raspberry and cherry sweetness, accented with smoky oak and brightened by crisp acidity. It shows the elegance that Calera Pinots are known for.

68789,US,"Made with a minimal-intervention mind-set, this marries classic French winemaking to tight, almost steely Willamette Valley fruit.

Drink 2018 through 2026.",93,80.0,Veneto

68798,US,"Toasty aromas lead the nose of this bottling from the Parker family's own vineyard, with brioche, freshly peeled lemon and a slight walnut touch.

68803,US,"A fine, delicious Chardonnay, less expensive than most of Testarossa's other single-vineyard Chards, but as good.

68804,Chile,"Aromatics of dill and vanilla are straight from the Old World, but otherwise this is modern and flush. Aromas of cedar and wood resin are also present in front of a tannic, roasted palate that features soft berry fruit, cola and medicinal flavors.

68805,France,"This structured wine comes from one of the lesser-known Grand Crus of Vosne-Romanée.

Drink from 2027.",95,650.0,Burgundy
68806,US,"The deep, dark color matches the deep, rich fruit and oak aromas, and the ripe, resounding dark cherry and cola flavors that follow. This is powerful, full-bodied Pinot Noir for a special occasion, maybe now, but there is no hurry. Should improve through 2020.",94,72.0,California
68807,US,"Crisp and flowery upon entry, this wine falls flat midpalate, offering a lopsided amount of ripe apple, pear and lemon curd that overpowers the more subtle aspects of minerality lurking in the background.",84,31.0,California

68809,US,"A strong, extracted Pinot, lacking delicacy and finesse. It's enormous in jammy raspberries, cherries and liqueur, with plenty of sweet, toasty oak.

68813,Australia,"This wine's aromas and flavors amount to an inconsistent mix of superripe (chocolate and prune) notes with those that are less so (herbal, tart raspberry) at first, but it does seem to settle down with some time in the glass, becoming more integrated but staying rather crisp on the finish.

68816,France,"Serious amounts of new wood dominate this still young wine. It has weight and there is great juicy black currant fruit underneath the dry wood character. Once it opens up again, this is going to be a delicious, structured wine. Drink from 2016.",89,50.0,Bordeaux
68817,France,"A very concentrated wine, almost too much in its overpowering richness. Peaches and crisper pears play with the spice, perfume and intense acidity. At the end, pepper shows the alcohol. For short-term aging over 3–4 years.",91,60.0,Alsace

68822,US,"The 2005 Leonetti Reserve is all estate vineyard fruit—63% Cabernet Sauvignon, 17% Merlot and 20% Petit Verdot. It is saturated and dense. The fruit is dark, smoky, herbal, tight and loaded with licorice, tea leaf, black olive, hints of tar and graphite. Tannins are in perfect proportion, polished and ripe, with extra texture and weight. The finish is granular and detailed, but delicious accent flavors of almond candy and nougat keep piling into the extraordinary finish.",97,125.0,Washington
68823,US,"Deep red plum, dried rose, lavender and oak smoke show on the nose of this bottling from Rick Longoria's estate vineyard, while it also offers a sanguine, feral quality.

68826,Italy,"The Lamborghini family makes some of the best wines you'll find from Umbria and this juicy, rich and beautifully extracted blend of Cabernet, Sangiovese and Montepulciano is a prime example.

It's a powerful wine, that ends on a bright, menthol-driven finish.",90,35.0,Central Italy
68827,US,"Another excellent vintage from Saffron Fields, under the guiding hand of veteran winemaker Tony Rynders.

68828,US,"Blackberry, tobacco, dried purple flowers and bloody meats greet the nose on this solid wine from pioneering winegrower Louis Lucas and his retired judge partner, Royce Lewellen.

68832,US,"This is a small, family-run estate situated in the heart of the appellation, with a bent for making elegantly styled wines.

The wine remains rich and velvety through a long finish.",93,90.0,California
68833,US,"Vanilla-soaked French toast and caramelized apples promise a butter bomb in this Testarossa take on the historic Sierra Madre Vineyard in the Santa Maria Valley. Once sipped, there is a surprising level of soda-like acidity, and a steadily emerging flavor profile that ranges from cream soda to squeezed lime.",90,45.0,California
68834,France,"Crisp and structured, this is an intensely mineral wine. It has great acidity and a strongly zesty, tangy character that still needs time to soften. It's bright, fruity and full of dancing freshness. It's good to go now, but keep until 2017 and it will be that much more complex.",92,,Champagne
68835,France,"Considering the relatively light nature of the vintage, this wine has been overmanipulated. Hard tannins and a bitter chocolate flavor are all too much for the fruit. A gentler approach would have been better.",86,35.0,Bordeaux
68836,South Africa,"The ever-creative Charles Back scores again with this blend of Shiraz, Cabernet, Merlot, Barbera and Primitivo. The nose offers red currant, cinnamon, cherry and vanilla, and on the palate, friendly fruit flavors are finished with a blast of fiery spice. The wine can age but is good today with spicy ribs, beef and assertive flavors.",89,13.0,Western Cape
68837,Argentina,"Sweet it is, but given the price it is good wine with mass appeal.

68840,US,"This isn't the greatest Long Meadow Ranch Cabernet ever, but it is a very fine wine, considering the cool vintage, and shows the winemaker's ability to play with the cards he was dealt. The wine is dry, with rich tannins framing blackberry, currant and cherry flavors with earthy hints of sage and tea. Drink now–2018.",90,47.0,California
68841,Germany,"A waxy lemon-peel note and a whiff of lanolin lend a mineral-driven slickness to this delicately textured, penetrating Riesling. Ripe tropical-fruit flavors are honeyed and intensely concentrated, yet the finish is elegant with a swathe of fresh, clean flowers.",90,23.0,Mosel
68842,US,"This wine kicks off with awesome aromatics of jasmine flowers, white beach, green tea and Rainier cherry. The palate is clean and crisp with ripe honeydew melon, Gala apple and Anjou pear flavors that are pleasant but simple.",87,16.0,California
68843,US,"Estate-grown, though it is not indicated on the label, this matches black raspberries to a lightly toasty frame. The wine spent just under a year in French oak prior to bottling. The fruit and oak components are in good proportion, but another year or two in bottle will help to meld the flavors.",88,29.0,Oregon
68844,US,"Has this vineyard ever produced anything less than a spectacular Pinot Noir? Hitching Post's '06 showcases its exotic spiciness and the way its power is modulated with an elegant structure. Cloves, nutmeg, allspice and white pepper are just a few of the spices that tantalize the cherry, orange and cola flavors. The wine feels wonderful in the mouth, rich and long-lasting. Ageable, too, with a window extending beyond 2012.",94,42.0,California
68845,US,"This is sourced from old vines, and brings typically intense, phenolic aromatics in a dry, extended and lingering style. Citrus-rind scents and dried-apple flavors abound, and it's textural and persistent, though not what you'd call fruity. The length and development are its best attributes.",90,22.0,Oregon
68846,US,"This is an enormously rich Cabernet. It explodes in milk chocolate, black cherry, spicy plum and sweet, toasty oak flavors, wrapped into smooth tannins. Delicious, if a bit one-dimensional. Drink now.",87,65.0,California
68847,France,"Steinbach is a village at the extreme southern end of the Alsace vineyard, known for its Pinot Noir. This is a rich, full example—a wine that has structure and concentration, as well as ripe cherry fruitiness. It can be drunk now, or until 2022.",90,35.0,Alsace
68848,US,"This is the most complex and detailed of the current single-vineyard Pinots from Rex Hill. English Breakfast tea, cherry liqueur, moist loam, dried leaf and highlights of cinnamon apple pie all contribute to a feminine, elegant, well-crafted wine.",93,65.0,Oregon

68854,US,"It's no surprise that this Amador Syrah spent 21 months in French oak. The wine is very tannic, savory with a wisp of pepper. Still, for a bigger, more tannic style mountain of Syrah it's got some good acidity midpalate and through the finish and could be interesting with a rich serving of duck, venison or game.",87,20.0,California
68855,US,"From a vineyard perched above the coastal town of Carpinteria comes this rich and spicy wine, with aromas of red currant, elderberry, crushed thyme, ginger and rose petals. The spicy character carries to the distinctive palate, where rosemary, thyme and lamb-meat savoriness meets with enough red cherry fruit to stay rich.",92,40.0,California
68856,Australia,"A blend of Mount Barker and Margaret River fruit, this is lavishly oaked, chocolaty and rich, as decadent a bottle of Cabernet you'll find in Australia.

68859,US,"A heady mixture of lemon custard and baked pear marks the entry to this full-bodied, deliciously decadent wine, from a high-elevation site above the Petaluma Gap. Honeyed aromas maintain themselves in the glass, accented in floral honeysuckle and ginger. Lovely and generous, it softens as it goes.",93,68.0,California
68860,US,"A big wine, rather ponderous now in the size and forwardness of its fruit and the volume of mainly new French oak. The fruit is massive, suggesting black and red sour cherry candy, with oak influences of smoky char and pencil shavings, and complex notes of minerals and sweet violet flowers. But it all needs time to come together. Tasted in a large flight of 2007 Rutherford Cabernets and Bordeaux blends, this was easily the star. Really hard to exaggerate the wine's beauty and elegance. Best 2013–2019, at least.",96,175.0,California
68861,Italy,"This structured ripasso has intense aromas of prune, raisin and graphite. The round and velvety palate offers a ripe blackberry core, spiced by accents of chocolate, mint, tobacco and bitter almond. Pair this with seasoned cheeses or spicy red-meat dishes.",89,22.0,Veneto
68862,US,"This wine reminds one of salty apple pie, with big, drying oak and a whiff of potpourri. Given nine months in 25% new French oak, it holds on to that toasty taste through the finish, with a sprinkling of bitter lemon.",84,30.0,California
68863,US,"Perfumed in cassis and chocolate, this wine starts out with soft layers of fruit, but lacks structure and definition, making for a simple, lighthearted quaff.",82,27.0,California

68865,Spain,"This Cabernet Sauvignon-led blend from the south-of-Madrid area represents no designated region other than Spain. It's an intense blend with aromas of blackberry, pepper, toasted oak and smokiness.

68868,US,"Estate grown and fermented with native yeasts, the Select cuvée is the entry level offering from Brick House.

68873,US,"Though it's a huge tannic monster right now, this Bordeaux blend, a first release and new brand name from Steven Kent Winery, is an ode to Steven Kent Mirassou's family's long lineage in California winemaking and the roots of Livermore's history in wine as well. A majority Cabernet (75%), with all the lush cassis and black cherry one would hope for, the wine shows nicely honed herbal notes from its 15% Cab Franc in the middle, with a little touch of spice on the finish coming from 5% Petit Verdot (3% Malbec and 2% Merlot round out the blend). Give this one time and it will surely reward.",94,125.0,California

68880,US,"This is a boldly expressive testament to the vineyard site from which it comes.

68881,US,"This blends 64% Syrah with 26% Cabernet Sauvignon and 10% Merlot to good effect, offering tomato leaf, leather, dried herb and lavender aromas. Savory, meaty and medium bodied on the palate, it pairs well with heavier fare.",91,65.0,California

68916,US,"Intensely aromatic, yet big and even chunky in the mouth, this young wine remains compressed and hard-edged.

68925,Chile,"A woody jammy nose is lush and borders on raisiny.

Although it's a bit full bodied and heavy for a Pinot Noir, it's stunningly good, offering wave after wave of berry, cherry, orange peel, spice and oak flavors, with interesting side notes of mushrooms, cola, cocoa and licorice.

68930,US,"The winemaker aged this wine for 20 months in 100% new French oak, resulting in an oak-dominated product that bears notes of buttered toast, butterscotch and caramel. Green apple and pear flavors can be found, but they're basically swamped.",84,45.0,California
68931,France,"With 30% of the harvest aged in new oak, this is a spicy, toasty wine. That shows through in the firm tannins that back up the rich black fruit. Produced from 30-year-old vines, it has concentration and a fine, solid texture. Drink from 2022.",91,45.0,Bordeaux

68933,US,"This shows the Diamond Creek signature of dryness, mountain tannins and voluptuously ripe, concentrated fruit. It's dense in blackberry jam and cassis flavors, with firm minerality and a lush toast note from the oak. Near perfection in all of its parts, it possesses those hard-to-define qualities of balance and elegance. Wonderful as it is now, the tannins suggest aging it for many years.",96,175.0,California
68934,Argentina,"An oaky wine that's funky at all checkpoints. The nose is briney and cheesy, while the palate is astringent and offers a speck of orange but mostly just resiny oak. And it's barrel city on the finish.",82,22.0,Mendoza Province

68942,US,"From the producer's 1,400-foot-high estate vineyard atop the Petaluma Gap, this wine is richly layered in boysenberry, baked cherry and pine.

68950,New Zealand,"Only a small proportion of barrel-aged wine goes into this blend, so the emphasis is on bright pear and melon fruit, backed by concentrated citrus flavors.

68953,Spain,"Big, brawny and not entirely welcoming: this Priorat heavyweight is full of licorice and cool black-fruit and cola aromas. The palate is hard as nails, and only time will tell if it softens and finds a sweeter spot.

68955,US,"One sip is all it takes to fall in love with this 100% Cabernet, which hails from the winery's Stags Leap District vineyards. It's soft, lush and opulent in blackberry, cherry, blueberry, cassis, dark chocolate and smoky oak flavors. Although it was aged in 100% new French oak, the oak isn't at all heavy. Rather, it's perfect, adding just the right touch of smoke. Really fabulous, and the tannins define Stags Leap, so strong yet sweetly refined.

68960,Australia,"Leads off with dusty, nutty, sugary aromas, like the bottom of the bag of honey-roasted peanuts, but there's also hints of buttered toast, ripe pears and black pepper. Flavors are simpler—caramel and pineapple—and it's heavy on the palate.",85,21.0,Western Australia
68961,France,"Big, ripe and juicy, this wears its rich black fruits right up front. A strong and firmly tannic structure serves as a background to the fruit.

68964,US,"This ripe, all-fruit wine tastes unoaked because a lush blend of apple, peach and pear crowds the aromas, and more of the same fruitiness expands in the flavors. The mouthfeel is especially gentle, and the finish almost sweet.",89,20.0,California
68965,US,"At five years, the wine still retains some charm, but is showing its age. It's   a little tired in structure, and the fruit is fading, turning dry and leathery. But there's cherries and cassis, with some complexity in the finish. Drink now.",87,20.0,California

68971,US,"This wine pushes the limits of what is commonly thought of as California Chardonnay. It's refreshingly brisk in light, citrusy quince and razor-sharp minerality. Vibrant, it showcases the site well, coaxing crystal clarity to complex layers of ginger-specked apple and pear.",91,45.0,California
68972,France,"Produced close to the sea at Bandol, this wine has a good proportion (20%) of Mourvèdre in the blend. That adds to the richness and brings out a fine aromatic floral character. Wild strawberries flavors give a rich ready-to-drink aftertaste.",87,13.0,Provence

68975,Australia,"Give this wine a few minutes to open up, and once it does it's a lovely example of cool climate Chardonnay.

Drink through 2024.",92,45.0,Oregon

68980,Argentina,"An oily white-fruit aroma is overrun by a heavy oak scent, leaving notes of resin and toast on the bouquet.

68981,Argentina,"Strained, funky aromas of corn chips don't include much fruit. This is mostly acid on the palate, while it tastes raw, choppy and citric. A tart finish fails to rescue this substandard rosé.",82,13.0,Mendoza Province
68982,South Africa,"An elegant and well-balanced Syrah, initial scents of red cherry and brambly berry lead into more refined notes of cola spice, game, leather and a touch of sweet smoke.

68984,US,"Encased in what seems to be the world's biggest bottle, this wine made by Jeff Cohn telegraphs excess on several fronts, from its price to its suggestion to decant one to two hours prior to enjoying, to its ripe strawberry jam sensibilities. Voluptuously big-boned and spicy, given 100% new French oak and a fair amount of whole cluster fermentation, it'll appeal to fans of frothy exuberance and may well be best after time in cellar, through 2018.",90,125.0,California

68993,France,"This is the coolest and freshest of the Grand Cru vineyards. The wine is tight, steely with a nervy core of acidity that gives it a textured, structured character.

69021,US,"This is a delightfully crisp, elegant and lip-smacking wine, that's subtle and easy to love.

Food friendly, it's also a great deal.",90,16.0,California
69022,US,"Here's a youthful Pinot Noir that tastes like it's still in the barrel. It's a bit heavy and very fruity, offering scads of red and black currants, cola, mocha, cedar and spice flavors. Could develop silkiness and complexity in the bottle after 2009.",86,50.0,California
69023,US,"The winery makes this wine from vines planted in 1959 that it now farms organically. In this vintage, they produced a hearty, sizable wine, ripe, soft and intense, in need of time to coax the blackberry and cassis fruit forward. Enjoy through 2025.",92,195.0,California

69031,Chile,"A bit of complexity dances across the bouquet: there's rubber, wood, anisette and mute red fruit; there's also some minty green aromas, too.

69196,Germany,"If there's any quibble with this wine, it's that the aromas and flavors remain in a very narrow range, from struck flint to citrus. Otherwise, it's a lovely dry Riesling, slightly plump and custardy on the palate yet crisp and sharply focused on the finish. Drink it over the next several years.",88,22.0,Pfalz
69197,US,"Hugely floral with jasmine and honeysuckle in aroma, this light, approachable white is also oaky and ripe in pineapple and papaya, with a lingering freshness of acidity.",86,16.0,California
69198,US,"Though labeled merlot, this is truly a Bordeaux-style blend with Cabernet Sauvignon (6%), Malbec (5%), and Petit Verdot (2%) added to the mix. It is reserved in style with notes of cherry, dried herbs and pickling spices backed by firm, dry tannins.",87,20.0,Oregon
69199,US,"This is a diluted, straightforward wine dotted in pleasing layers of pear and papaya. It finishes clean and quick.",84,28.0,California
69200,France,"This firmly structured, beautifully crafted wine has a solid backdrop of tannins and plenty of concentration. Beyond that, it is already well balanced, bringing together its dark texture and blackberry fruit flavors with generous acidity. It needs to age, drink from 2020.",94,,Bordeaux
69201,US,"Smells a little funky and leathery, with an exaggeratedly sweet taste to the blackberries and cherries. The end impression is of a wine that's certainly ripe, but a little awkward, maybe even problematic. Seems best now.",86,75.0,California
69202,US,"Cabernet specialist Baldacci tries their hand at Pinot Noir, and what do you know? It's a Cabernet-esque Pinot, which means its heavy and full bodied. There's plenty of savory blackberry essence, but the challenge is to bring grace and lightness to this variety.",85,40.0,California
69203,France,"This second wine of Château Cheval Blanc is ripe, dominated by soft, juicy Merlot. It is rich, full of jammy red berry fruits and finely integrated, gentle tannins. It's full bodied, generous and developing well. Drink from 2017.",91,,Bordeaux
69204,US,"A restrained and somewhat backward reserve, this is hiding its fruit behind a dry, somewhat earthy, wall of tannin. There are interesting nuances of seed, leaf and stem, along with a base fruit flavor of raspberry/cranberry, and the wine persists into a slightly bitter finish, but it seems to be holding itself back. A second bottle was better, with a little more fruit.",87,27.0,Washington
69205,Argentina,"Reduced, jammy aromas of blueberry and bacon turn gritty with airing. This feels heavy, chunky and struggles for balance. Stewy, medicinal blueberry flavors finish sticky, with a mix of green, candied berry and caramel notes.",84,16.0,Mendoza Province
69206,US,"This iconic regional vineyard is widely sourced, and this bottling presents it well.

The palate surrounds a core of lemon-lime-laced apple and fleshy ripe pear, with guava skin on the finish. Very easy to drink.",91,36.0,California
69207,Argentina,"Nothing much sublime about Sublimis. The nose is reedy and sweet, with licorice and overripe raisiny aromas. The palate is big and grabby, with clamp-down tannins and hard, crusty raisiny flavors. A bruising red without elegance.",82,18.0,Mendoza Province
69208,Austria,Creamy notes introduce an earthier dimension to this lemon-scented wine that has an equally lemon-focused core and a rather slender body. This is slight and cannot make up its mind whether it wants to be sharp or creamy—so it oscillates between these poles.,89,30.0,Kamptal
69209,Italy,"This opens with aromas suggesting toasted nut, oak and bread crust. The soft palate offers mature yellow apple skin, toast, citrus zest and a confectionary note alongside a creamy perlage. Bitter almond marks the finish.",88,54.0,Lombardy
69210,US,"A special bottling commemorating Edwards' 40 years as a winemaker, this wine is made from a clonal selection created by her in 1975. The fruit is from both the Coopersmith and Georganne vineyards, made in a tiny amount.

A forested hint of spearmint dances at its edge, as strong suggestions of bacon and pepper build on the finish. Drink now through 2028.",92,96.0,California
69211,France,"A wine that seems to be all tannin, all wood, with only a feel of black currant fruits underneath all this dryness. These flavors suggest high extraction, giving spice, a high toast wood character, all too much for a delicate 2007.",84,11.0,Bordeaux

69225,US,"This could be labeled Merlot, which comprises three-quarters of the Bordeaux-style blend.

69232,US,"Floral and exotic, the tingling acidity in this wine is the standout, but it's equally buoyed by a mouth-filling texture adorned by a sensation of fresh-squeezed lime and grapefruit.

The characteristic blackberry fruit shines through, but winemaker Adam Campbell has wrapped it in the sort of elegant, lightly herbal, spicy flavors that define the Elk Cove style. Perfectly ripened at 14.5% alcohol, this wine manages to be both fruity and complex, open and layered.",91,38.0,Oregon
69303,Argentina,"Ripe, fruity and jammy on the nose, with smokiness and earth to go with standard berry aromas. The palate leans towards full and jammy, with sweet berry and mild spice flavors. Chunky and full-bodied, but for the most part it gets things right.",87,16.0,Mendoza Province
69304,US,"This is a suave and supple wine, with a luxuriously smooth texture. From one of Anderson Valley's fabled vineyard sites, this offers softness and easy drinkability, balanced by a firm backing of fruit tones, acidity and fine tannins.",92,55.0,California
69305,France,"Rich and round, the wine boasts ripe toast and creamy pear and peach fruit. The lemon touches give point to this full wine, adding attractive freshness.",88,18.0,Burgundy
69306,US,"Simple and watery, but not without charm, this Chardonnay has lemon, lime, pear and oak flavors. It's soft, with some herbal interest.",85,18.0,California
69307,France,"This single-parcel, partially barrel-fermented Champagne is in effect a Blanc de Noirs. If all that sounds complicated (and so does the name of the wine), the wine itself is much easier to appreciate. It is certainly rich, with a touch of tannin and mineral texture. Full of ripe white fruits, it offers good acidity at the end. It could age longer; drink from 2017.",93,70.0,Champagne
69308,France,"Produced in vineyards close to Mont Saint-Victoire in the west of the Provence vineyards, this perfumed, floral wine has crisp acidity along with orange and citrus flavors. The wine is light, very fruity and bright at the end.",86,19.0,Provence
69309,US,"Named after winemaker David Corey's son, this 74% Cabernet Sauvignon, 19% Cabernet Franc, 4% Petit Verdot and 3% Merlot begins with nose-tickling scents of berry syrup and smoked cigars. The maduro cigar flavor consumes the palate, with black cherry fruit and smooth tannins. It can stand up to a fat stogie or gamy meats like lamb.",90,42.0,California
69310,US,"Velvety, lush and bright, this wine celebrates a warm, wonderful vintage in its exuberance of clove, currant and chocolate-covered cherry, yet the acidity is focused and tense. Lengthy and built to last, the rounded palate is seasoned in black pepper.",94,225.0,California
69311,France,"This is a medium-bodied, fruit-driven Syrah that seems built for immediate consumption. Black cherry fruit is in the lead, with hints of chocolate and lavender to spice things up. Eminently quaffable, with bright fruit and a lingering finish.",87,26.0,Rhône Valley
69312,Argentina,"Dry and balsamic on the bouquet, with earthy, mellow berry aromas that do not push. In the mouth, it comes across charred and roasted, with baked, chocolaty, leafy accents on top of core red fruit flavors. Turns more leafy and charred as it unfolds, with a forward finish. Malbec with Cab Sauvignon and Merlot.",89,120.0,Mendoza Province
69313,US,"This is the winery's Left-Bank-Bordeaux-style blend, three quarters Cabernet Sauvignon. It has a pleasing mix of red and black fruits, licorice, toast and smoke, and spent two and a half years in French oak, 60% new. The wine is quite tasty and drinking well, though the blend lacks focus.",88,35.0,Washington
69314,France,"A finely balanced wine, preserving the mineral edge and keeping fine acidity while displaying  ripe white and yellow fruits.",89,35.0,Burgundy
69315,France,"It's a shame so much high-toast wood was used in aging this wine. Under those flavors of smoky wood, some black fruit wants to come out. The wine does have the weight, and it will be worth waiting until 2018 before drinking.",87,22.0,Bordeaux
69316,US,"This is dry, with scouring tannins and some twiggy, stalky bitterness. It has just enough blackberry flavor to get by. For the price, it's fine for big parties.",83,8.0,California
69317,Israel,"There's a bit of warmth to the nose of this wine, but forest berry and red cherry aromas and flavors keep things vibrant and flavorful. It's approachable now with soft tannins and an easygoing structure, ending with a hint of milk chocolate.",87,,Israel
69318,US,"Somewhat rugged, with edgy tannins, but very flavorful, a nice wine to have with Italian-inspired pasta dishes. Made from Syrah and Sangiovese, with a splash of Cabernet, it's dry and tart, and shows blackberry, cherry and currant flavors.",87,25.0,California
69319,US,"This is a rich, jammy wine, with ripe raspberry, cherry and spice flavors. Blended with a little Merlot and Petit Verdot, it's made in the popular style, featuring sweet fruit with a touch of oak. The tannins are pretty thick, and the wine might improve with a few years in the cellar.",87,45.0,California
69320,US,"Easier to find than Jeriko's Pommard or Dijon bottlings, the Reserve is dark and earthy with mushroom, dark cherry and a tiny bit of spice floating behind the scenes. The 14.7% alcohol level brings this wine into a bigger style of Pinot territory but is welldone and should get even better with time.",88,38.0,California
69321,Australia,"The 2015 vintage in Mornington yielded dark concentrated wines. This one is atypically (for the estate) full bodied and bold as a result, with plum and black-cherry fruit and hints of mint, sage and bay leaf. Long and a bit drying on the finish, it needs a couple of years to come into balance. Drink 2020–2030.",92,56.0,Victoria
69322,US,"The wine is tight, sharp, aromatic, tart and juicy, with dry tannins that take over quickly. Though quite acidic for this vineyard, it displays classic Champoux fruit flavors of Bing cherry, blueberry and cassis. It's drinking beautifully, smooth and supple, finishing with a balanced mix of mocha and coconut.",91,50.0,Washington
69323,Argentina,"Waxy, floral white-fruit aromas are tropical in style. This feels citrusy, with some pulpiness to the texture. Tangerine, orange and nectarine flavors finish tangy and citric, with one-dimensional juiciness.",85,11.0,Mendoza Province
69324,US,"A hearty but not overdone blend of 73% Petite Sirah, 18% Tannat and 9% Petit Verdot, this well-named wine shows asphalt, black pepper, violet and a sourish blueberry on the nose. Ripe boysenberry fruit pops on the palate, as do lavender and peppercorn. The flavors grow a tad more tart as the sip lingers.",88,52.0,California
69325,US,"Other wineries come and go. Raymond remains, offering solid Napa Valley Cab at a fair price. The '05 Reserve calls to mind the very fine 2000, but actually costs less. It's a dry, elegantly structured wine, rich in sweet fine tannins, and offering up complex, delicious flavors of freshly picked ripe blackberries, spicy cassis, baked cherry pie and smoky oak. Drink now through 2015.",93,35.0,California
69326,US,"Green Valley vineyards figure prominently in this appellation wine, providing delicate, layered acidity and crisp, savory, succulent fruit. Cranberry, cherry and black tea flavors ripple through its bright texture, accented with clove, cola and cedar.",90,42.0,California
69327,US,"A tart, astringent Pinot, it needs a bit more time in bottle to flesh out further. Tart red fruits are accented with muted herbal elements and just a light touch of barrel toast.",88,40.0,Oregon
69328,US,"Tasty and easy to drink, this has blackberry, black currant and cola flavors that finish seemingly sweet and oaky. It's an intense wine that doesn't seem likely to make gains with age, so drink up after an hour or two in the decanter.",87,45.0,California
69329,US,"Lots of fruit flavors and lots of tannin make this both generous and a bit tight at the same time. While the ripe black cherry and blackberry aromas and flavors are tempting, the texture is firm and may need until 2018 to smooth for best drinking.",87,16.0,California
69330,South Africa,"There's a vegetable character to this wine, with notes of tomato and meat that overwhelm the fruity tones of yellow apple, mealy melon and bitter orange. The palate is astringent and sharp, with a tart, bitter finish.",84,16.0,Coastal Region
69331,France,"This wine is firm with solid tannins. It has rich fruit and concentration with layers of blackberry and dark plums. It comes from a small seven-acre property and is aged for 15 months in wood. This impressive wine needs to age, so drink from 2022.",92,35.0,Bordeaux
69332,France,"Although this wine does not come from a premier-cru vineyard, it hails from a single vineyard that regularly produces delicious white wines. This bottling, rich as befits the year, also has an attractive bright, crisp edge that contrasts with the warm yellow fruits. Drink the wine from 2019.",90,40.0,Burgundy
69333,US,"Supple and layered, this nicely captures the scope and scale of this superb vintage. It's still young, tight and quite compact, but shows threads of tobacco, anise, stone and pencil lead, along with full, fleshy, plum and cassis fruit. Great structure and dense, ripe tannins. This is a perfect illustration of why Washington Merlot can claim to be the best in the world outside of Pomerol.",93,36.0,Washington
69334,Germany,"Two years of aging on the lees renders incredible textural dimension to this decadently silky dry Riesling. Fresh white grapefruit, lime and lemon notes shine on the palate, offsetting expansive mouthfeel, with acidity that's focused and precise. Stunning already, but should evolve dramatically through 2025.",93,236.0,Mosel
69335,US,"Touches of vanilla accent flavors of freshly pressed apples and pears in this bold, full-bodied wine. Piercing lemon acidity adds freshness to the palate, but the finish is a bit warming overall.",86,20.0,New York
69336,US,"Marked by jammy fruit and high acidity, this Syrah is strong in cherries, raspberries and oak. It's not especially subtle, but it is pretty and polished, and could even acquire bottle complexity over the next 3–4 years.",86,29.0,California
69337,Austria,"Toast and caramel notes mingle with mocha and dark plum flavors, resulting in a sleek wine with soft yet palpable tannins. As it opens up, soft plum and cherry fruit is revealed. The concentrated midpalate also signals that this will age and develop well.",90,55.0,Carnuntum
69338,US,"Even though the alcohol is a high 15.3% abv, this Cabernet tastes like it still has some residual sweetness. It's as rich and ripe in blackberries, but awkward, and doesn't seem capable of aging.",85,80.0,California
69339,Australia,"At around $20 per bottle, this is a solid Pinot Noir for the money. It's medium in body and silky in texture, with black cherry fruit and subtle shadings of iris and vanilla that ling on the finish. Drink now–2020.",90,,Victoria
69340,US,"Quite an impressive young Chardonnay, with brisk acidity, a tangy minerality and a bone dry finish. You'll find suggestions of pineapple, Meyer lemon, lime and kiwi flavors, with a kiss of smoky oak. Chill it well, then savor it as it warms in the glass.",92,28.0,California
69341,Australia,"In 2009 this single vineyard offering includes 11% Sémillon. It has wonderful texture, and a mix of light herbal flavors that run through a gamut from celery to lemongrass and up into tart citrus fruit. The acidity is generous but not searing; it penetrates but never overpowers. A quintessential food wine.",90,50.0,South Australia
69342,US,"The initial entry to this wine is reminiscent of cheesecake, with a decadence to the bouquet. From there, ripe pear and toasted oak combine around a tropical edge of guava and papaya, giving complexity and lushness on the palate, before a zesty, slightly tart finish confounds and invites one in for more. Cellar through 2018.",92,65.0,California
69343,US,"Soft and smooth around the edges, this Rhône-style red blend is made mostly from Grenache and is nevertheless assertive in its earthy, spicy aromas and baked fruit flavors. The texture feels polished while the fine tannins and acidity keep it firm enough to be appetizing.",88,28.0,California
69344,US,"Chardonnays this rich need crisp acidity, minerality and a dry finish to balance them. That is exactly what you'll find in this beautiful example, from one of the appellation's best vineyards. It's bountiful in oranges, apricots and mangoes, with plenty of buttered toast, yet there's a mouthwatering tartness that makes you reach for another glass.",92,40.0,California
69345,New Zealand,"This medium-bodied Sauvignon Blanc boasts a slightly oily texture to go along with decently intense aromas of stone fruit and fresh herbs. Flavors of pineapple, currant and tomato leaf provide a good introduction to Marlborough Sauvignon. Imported by Five Gold Hands.",87,11.0,Marlborough
69346,France,This is a light- to medium-bodied rosé made exclusively from Syrah grown in the northern reaches of the Rhône Valley. The cooler climate gives it a lighter bearing and redder fruit flavors than many other Rhône rosés: this one resembles red plum and pineapple. Drink now.,84,16.0,Rhône Valley
69347,US,"The impressively plump and prominent strawberry and red-currant aromas are alluring on the nose, enhanced by touches of cinnamon and pepper dust. The palate combines savory pepper spice, red plums and berries, with a solidly simmering acidity shimmering through the entire sip.",96,62.0,California
69348,New Zealand,"This Pinot takes a few minutes to open up, yet when it does it smells like dusting polish and Dr. Pepper. The palate is more subtle with a good lick of acidity and chewy tannins finishing on dark cherry fruit. It's not the most typical example of this region or grape variety, but it has its charms nonetheless.",87,33.0,Central Otago
69349,US,"Sangiovese makes up 45% of this blend, with the balance Barbera (22%), Malbec (22%) and Cabernet Franc. The barrel treatment is at the fore, with notes of baking spice and vanilla that are followed by aromas of dried cherry and herb. The palate is full bodied, loaded with appealing tart cranberry and cherry flavors.",88,25.0,Washington
69350,France,"High acidity gives this wine freshness, while the fruitiness is somewhat more distant. It could age, but the bitter edge and the acidity are difficult to get past.",84,28.0,France Other
69351,US,"You can taste the warm Paso Robles sunshine in every sip of this exuberant Cabernet. It brims with jammy blackberries, black cherries and chocolate, yet the finish is dry. Be aware of quite high alcohol, though, that gives it prickly heat.",86,29.0,California
69352,US,"Cabernet Sauvignon (45%) and Cabernet Franc (42%) take the lead on this blend. The aromas suggest notes of dried herb, cherry, vanilla and pencil shavings while the palate offers elegantly styled dark-fruit flavors with toasty accents.

69353,US,"Packaged in a plain, stylish bottle with the RR logo prominently displayed, this reserve-level cuvée brings concentrated flavors of citrus, apple, peach and pear, along with highlights of wet paper, fresh herb and lemongrass.

69356,Germany,"Plush and supple, this is an easy-drinking blend of Dornfelder, Portugieser, Merlot and Cabernet Sauvignon. It's a soft, juicy wine full of primary black cherry and berry flavors, without even a whisper of tannins, but enjoyable for uncomplicated, immediate consumption.",85,14.0,Rheinhessen
69357,Chile,"Veramonte's first high-end Ritual Sauvignon is a big success. The nose is mellow, refined and minerally as opposed to pungent and feline. The feel is fresh, clean as a razor, and easygoing, with lime, nectarine and passion fruit flavors. Long and lightly green on the classy finish.",90,20.0,Casablanca Valley
69358,US,"This wine, which includes 17% Grenache, is a blend of fruit from Les Collines, Discovery and Riviere Galets vineyards. Smoked meat, dried herb and baking-spice aromas are followed by red-fruit flavors that display a sense of elegance.",88,36.0,Washington

69360,US,"Dense black cherry and blueberry fruit lead into a candied-grape element on the nose of this wine that also offers maple syrup, vanilla and lilac touches. The blend of 60% Malbec, 20% Cabernet Sauvignon and 20% Syrah is fruity on the sip, with kirsch and crème de cassis flavors held up by strong tannins and acidity.",89,55.0,California
69361,US,"Bright red currant is complemented by dark, brooding black fruit tones in this complex, nuanced and grippy wine, young and showy in its mountain genetics. Forest floor, mint, cedar and graphite fleck the fruit, with complexity knocking on the door.",94,99.0,California
69362,US,"This 100% varietal wine shows notes of raspberry and chocolate sprinkled with oak spices from time in 50% new French barrels. It's wound up tightly at present, packed to the brim with red fruit flavors and firm, slightly gritty tannins.",91,58.0,Washington
69363,US,"Dramatically rich in pie filling blackberries, currants and anise, this Syrah is given complexity by the firm tannins and crisp acidity that the Highlands appellation invariably brings to red wines. It has a complexity and depth that make it irresistable. Now through 2010 for youthful freshness.",92,33.0,California
69364,France,"Steeliness exemplified in wine. This is crisp and structured, complex with its green fruits, structured acidity and touch of caramel and kiwi. It's the acidity that shows at the moment; needs 4–5 years.",92,34.0,Burgundy
69365,US,"Soft and middle-aged, it offers a serious bite on the finish that veers slightly into sour cherry and mushroom territory, the end result a bit dull.",84,25.0,California
69366,Germany,"Whiffs of white mushroom, saffron and caramel lend complexity to this concentrated elixir of apricots and orange peels. It's honeyed and sweet but vivaciously balanced, glazing the palate in ethereal textures of gossamer and tulle. The caramel finish lingers endlessly.",96,365.0,Rheingau

69369,US,"There's a tannic toughness to this young wine. It's like chewing on dried black currants. Once they start to dissolve in the mouth, lovely flavors of sweet blackberries emerge, and then take over through a very long, spicy finish. It's quite a beautiful Napa Cabernet, but it does need time. Best 2013–2019.",94,82.0,California

69371,Austria,"Always the star of sweet wines, this TBA Riesling preserves so much freshness while also being packed with honeyed, ripe apricot and mango fruits. It is the acidity along with the dry botrytis that make the wine so special and offer considerable aging potential— give it seven years or more.",95,,Niederösterreich
69372,US,"Aromas like cedar and heavily toasted bread meet very ripe black cherry and plum flavors, for a full-bodied wine that's not shy about the oak influence. While the wine is big, the texture is rather soft and smooth.",87,13.0,California

69375,US,"This winery produces a vast array of wines, yet Syrah seems to thrive best in this vineyard deep up the Santa Maria Valley.

It brings a sense of purity of flavor that captures the attention.",91,65.0,Washington

69379,New Zealand,"Even one of Marlborough's best and most consistent producers faced some challenges in 2012. This wine shows a slight surfeit of vegetal notes like sweet peas and tomato leaf that don't quite harmonize with the otherwise honeyed, ripe passion-fruit flavors. The texture in the mouth is still silky, the finish still long, but drink up, or look for the 2013.",89,,Marlborough

69383,US,"This is a very powerful Chardonnay, brimming in guava, golden mango, white peach, pear and Key lime pie flavors, to which smoky oak adds even richer layers of butterscotch and caramel.

69385,US,"A smidgen of Cabernet Franc is blended into this wine, the grapes sourced from vineyards on both Diamond and Howell mountains.

69387,US,"This is a softly sophisticated Cabernet that will please fans of the variety who want a wine that's a little earthier than your riper Napa Valley versions.

Should develop over the next 7–8 years.",89,34.0,California
69388,Chile,"Herbal red-fruit aromas come across scratchy and suggestive of fresh field greens.

Drink this blend of Cabernet Sauvignon, Cabernet Franc and Carmenère now.",89,25.0,Maipo Valley
69389,US,"The latest entrant into the Napa Cabernet sweepstakes succeeds with this flashy wine. Made from grapes grown in the warm Vaca Hills east of the Silverado Trail, this wine impresses immediately with aromatics of black currants, mocha and lightly toasted French oak.

This is a winery to watch.",94,85.0,California

69395,Australia,"De Bortoli's unique approach to harvest timing and extensive use of new oak leaves this wine seeming rather disjointed: coffee and cola notes dominate the tart, cranberryish fruit flavors. I suspect it will show better with a few years' of cellaring, but until then, I remain unconvinced.",84,60.0,Victoria
69396,US,"This is a great Cabernet, blended with a drop of Petit Verdot. It shows the intensity of mountain fruit, with incredibly concentrated black currant and cassis flavors, with superb tannins. Few Cabernets have shown this degree of ageability. Drink now–2024",94,135.0,California

69514,US,"Production was 10,000 cases, amazing when you consider how good this mountain wine is. Immediately drinkable for the soft purity of the tannins and complex cassis, chocolate and oak flavors, it has the sturdy structure to develop for some years, but is best now for its elegant purity. Hess is on a real Cabernet roll, and is one of Napa's overlooked stars.",92,50.0,California
69515,US,"Ripe aromas of passionfruit, ruby red grapefruit and a juicy grass element show on the nose of this wine by Andres Ibarra and Caren Rideau. That ripeness tightens on the palate, with Granny Smith apple skins, yellow grapefruit juice and pressed green apples.",87,24.0,California
69516,US,"Bright cherry fruit expands in the glass, with a hard-candy character, juicy acids, and polished tannins. It's forward, as per the vintage, but structured for further development. Pretty spices and a lick of caramel come up in the finish. Drink now through 2025.",94,60.0,Oregon
69517,US,"California-based Siduri cellared and bottled this wine that was vinified in Oregon. Still young and compact, it nonetheless shows some good flesh on its bones. The tannins pop out a bit, along with red berries and a streak of coffee. Another year of bottle age would be helpful, or give it plenty of aeration.",89,39.0,Oregon
69518,Argentina,"Snappy red fruit aromas endow this Cab with approachability, while the palate is clean, tasty and a little lean, with spicy, piquant raspberry flavors. Dry and peppery on the finish, but honest and clean throughout. Average wine; good value.",85,9.0,Mendoza Province
69519,France,"A wonderfully aromatic nose presents orange blossom and tangerine zest, Seville orange and ripe mandarin. All of these notions are joyously bundled on the concentrated dry palate that is brightened with even more zesty lemon freshness. There is drive here and an arrow-like structure that is energetic and totally refreshing. Uncompromising freshness, expressed with exuberant citrus charm, enlivens everything. The absolutely dry finish is invigorating and lasting. Drink 2018–2035.",95,35.0,Alsace

69521,US,"Hard grape candy and melted dark chocolate show on the nose of this blend of 50% Cabernet Sauvignon, 25% Merlot and 25% Petit Verdot from a vineyard near Happy Canyon.

69523,US,"A tart, cranberry- and raspberry-flavored wine, this young, high-acid style of Pinot has a charming, Burgundian feeling to it. The snappy red fruits are underscored with citrus, and the balance is disarmingly light, but not simple or dull.",88,43.0,Oregon
69524,England,"Hints of tart redcurrant have a softenting creamy edge. The palate fizzes with tiny bubbles that disperse the red-fruited, creamy tartness across the palate.

69528,US,"Great acidity and minerality in this elegant young wine. Doesn't show the rich concentration of De Loach's single-vineyard Chards, but then again, it costs far less. It's actually a good value for a dry, minerally and complex Russian River Chardonnay. Don't drink it too cold.",90,18.0,California
69529,US,"This is a soft, ductile blend of Cabernet Sauvignon, Petit Verdot, Merlot, Cabernet Franc and Touriga Nacional. It bears dusty tannins that add subtle texture, and a turmeric flavor adds an exotic edge to the palate.",84,35.0,Virginia

69531,Chile,"Spicy aromas of balsam wood, tobacco and sawmill work well with ripe but reserved red-berry scents. Tight, tannic but also fresh as opposed to drying, this Cabernet from a cool year delivers a classic set of herbal berry, plum and wood spice flavors.

69532,Austria,"The Wess style is for rounded wines, with a ripe, creamy texture. While this Terrassen is all about fresh fruit, it also has the same extra richness in its makeup.

69535,South Africa,"Some feline essence aromas appear on the nose with supporting notes of tart gooseberry and wet, dewey grass. Citrus dominates the creamy mouth with accents of cantaloupe leading through to the long finish. Try with hearty chicken salads or whole grilled fish.",85,11.0,Durbanville

69543,US,"The blend is Syrah, Cabernet Sauvignon and Grenache. The alcohol is high, which helps balance the apparent sweetness of this wine. The result is raspberry jam.",85,45.0,California
69544,Spain,"Gritty, stalky aromas override the wine's plum and berry scents. This feels acidic and rough, with abrasive tannins. Thus the flavors are tight, juicy and narrow, with an emphasis on red fruits. Minerality and acidity drive the finish.",85,42.0,Catalonia
69545,Australia,"Sure it's oaky, but it's good oak, contributing complex aromas of burnt sugar, smoke and bacon fat to an otherwise straightforward peach-and-pear-flavored Chardonnay. The disparate elements converge in a harmonious finish that invites you back for another sip.",88,15.0,Australia Other
69546,US,"Tough and gritty for a Merlot, with sweet and sour cherry and blackberry flavors wrapped into stringy tannins. With its briary, peppery finish, it could almost be a Zinfandel.",86,24.0,California

69548,US,"This has a traditional medium-garnet color with brick rim. Effusive aromas that are smoky, beefy and earthy lead to distinctive wild berry, sage and cherry flavors. The texture is smooth but nicely supported by acid and tannins, and all the complexity of this wine lingers on the finish.",92,28.0,California
69549,US,"This sports some chewy, herbaceous qualities that hit you right away. That intensity puts the focus on the wine's edges rather than its core fruit flavors of rhubarb and cranberry. Tight and stiff, it's got a puckery bite that suggests further bottle age may be a good idea.",89,52.0,Oregon
69550,France,"This wine comes from the stony slopes above the river Tarn, 45 minutes northeast of Toulouse. That gives it its strongly mineral texture and powerful tannins. A blend of rare and local Duras, Braucol and Prunelard grapes, it's firm and structured while also full of great black fruit and potential. Drink from 2021.",93,23.0,Southwest France

69552,Greece,"This red blends Xinomavro, the “acid black” grape found most in Macedonia, and Syrah. The Xinomavro gives the wine its tannic, slightly spiky edge, while Syrah rounds the character out with juicy fruit and softer spices. Overall, an assertive, ageworthy red that will pair well with grilled lamb or beef.",86,,Macedonia
69553,Italy,"Made of 80% Cabernet Sauvignon and 20% Merlot, this opulent wine evokes black currant, underbrush and vanilla on the nose.

69556,US,"This 100% Cabernet spent nearly two years in 100% new French oak. As a result, it's enormously oaky in youth. You can barely smell or taste anything beyond toothpicks. But the wine is still young and very tannic, and with a massive core of blackberries, cherries and dark chocolate, it's a ticking time bomb, just waiting to explode. Hold for at least six years and see what happens.",93,150.0,California
69557,Argentina,"Lagarde regularly makes consistent, true wines and this Cab is compact, solid and smooth, with spice and a lot of berry fruit on the nose. Refined, deep and pure on the palate, with blackberry, marzipan and licorice flavors. Very nice Argentine Cabernet for the money. Drink now into 2011.",90,15.0,Mendoza Province
69558,France,"Beautiful, aromatic wine, with raspberry fruit floating above the spice and toast. This is shot through with acidity and some dense tannins, but above all it is the piercing fruit that dominates. One of Jadot's signature wines, it is wonderful, with considerable aging potential.",96,125.0,Burgundy
69559,Argentina,"Not all that expressive on the nose; about all you get is basic yellow fruit and lettuce. The palate shows more intensity, but the flavors of lemon and tropical fruits are basic at best. Chunky, sweet and common on the finish. Good for Argentina but still it leaves you asking for more.",86,15.0,Mendoza Province
69560,Spain,"Spicy berry, creamy oak and tire-rubber aromas lead to a ripe, rugged but manageable palate. This 80% Monastrell and 20% Cabernet Sauvignon tastes of ripe black plum and sweet, spicy oak. Some heat and a peppery blackness take over on the finish.",87,15.0,Levante
69561,US,"A little harsh in texture, but otherwise a pretty nice, dry Cabernet that should benefit from decanting. From the esteemed producer, Goldschmidt, it's filled with briary flavors of blackberries and cherries.",86,17.0,California
69562,US,"Hints of crushed stones lend a mineral focus to this dry, elegantly structured wine. It's piercingly tart on the palate with loads of fresh lime and lemon flavor, but gains richness on the midpalate with streaks of fresh apple and crisp yellow peach. A hint of saffron adds spice to the moderately long finish.",87,22.0,New York

69565,US,"Darkly toasted oak, dried herb and mushroom notes add warmth and earthiness to this delicately fruity Pinot Noir. The palate is ruddy and rustic with subtle sour-cherry sweetness, but bright acidity and a swathe of green herb drive the fresh, clean finish.",86,30.0,New York

69568,Spain,"Cherry, red currant and minerally aromas are fresh and appealing. This blend of Tempranillo, Garnacha and Cabernet Sauvignon is pure and lithe on the palate, while toasty, minerally berry and cherry flavors finish dry, focused and with notes of licorice, cocoa and herbs. This succeeds by offering a little bit of everything good; drink through 2019.",91,18.0,Catalonia
69569,US,"There's a fresh, lilting quality to this Pinot, a silky airiness that feels weightless on the palate. Doubtless that's due to the moderate alcohol. But there's nothing light about the flavors, which are complex in black raspberry pie, softened Dr. Pepper cola, butterscotch, toast and spices. A beautiful Russian River Pinot made for drinking now with upscale fare.",90,49.0,California
69570,US,"Fermented in stainless steel barrels, this wine is a vibrant red hue, with strong dried cherry, cranberry and orange aromas. Full-bodied and concentrated, it's a dry and substantial rosé.",90,18.0,California
69571,US,"You'll want to give this vigorous young Cab time in the cellar to come around. It's tannic and closed now, and the blackberry and cherry fruit has a primary fruit jamminess that wants to develop some bottle-aged characteristics. Give it until 2017 to begin to come around.",92,65.0,California
69572,US,"Fresh wildflower and pear aromas, with just a hint of yeastiness, introduce a bold, textured palate that's full of flower and stone fruit flavors. Striking acidity drives the long, penetrating finish.",87,18.0,New York
69573,France,"A blending of recent good vintages, this young-tasting Champagne is at the delicious fruit stage. It is crisp, citrus-flavored and bright with fruitiness. As it develops, the more mineral texture will come through, giving a richer, impressive wine that retains a zesty character. Ideally wait a few months after purchase before drinking.",93,45.0,Champagne
69574,France,"Rich and powerful, this is a spicy wine flavored with caramel and apricot. There is a layer of high toast that is out of balance with the fruit, and needs time to calm down. Wait 6–9 months.",87,30.0,Burgundy
69575,US,"Whiffs of sweet baking spice, cedar and tobacco entice from nose to finish on this unabashedly fruity and oaky, but enjoyable Cab. Juicy vanilla-cherry cola notes permeate the rich palate, cut by a razor's edge of acidity on the finish.",87,26.0,New York
69576,US,"Incredibly pure and pristine on the nose, notes of citrus cream, sea spray and white flowers hover over a base of white peach in this northern Michigan Chardonnay. With two years in French oak (25% new) and extended lees aging, the palate is round and sultry, boasting lightly brûléed lemon and zesty mineral notes that build to toasted hazelnut. A preserved-lemon finish lingers and leaves the palate wanting more. In time, the acidity will soften and this wine will truly sing. Drink now–2018.",91,28.0,Michigan

69581,US,"Shows a tightly wound structure, with big, hard tannins wrapped like a vise around fresh flavors of blackberries, cherries and cassis. There's a firm, minerally tang of iron at the core of this ageworthy wine. Better after 2015, when it should begin to mellow.",94,50.0,California

69586,US,"Fine and pure, this is a very good representative of Oak Knoll. The vintage had lots of warmth, coaxing ripe blackberry and currant flavors from the grapes, while preserving dryness, vital tannins and crisp acid structure. Overall, it is elegant and luscious. Good as it is now, give this at least six years.",93,90.0,California
69587,US,"Light, thinly textured but packed with ripe plum and dark raspberry flavor, this Sierra Foothills Syrah is fleshy, and reflects a warmer climate, more fruit-forward and brooding than leathery or inundated with spice.",85,29.0,California
69588,US,"This is a top bottling from one of the appellation's first superstar wineries. Aromas of baked red cherry and red plum are dusted with nutmeg, clove and a crushed-slate minerality.

It's extremely delicious and deeply layered.",95,82.0,California
69589,Chile,"Apple juice aromas don't hold it together for long, and the palate is spritzy and acidic. Apple cider and a touch of vinegar and citrus are the flavors. Not the type of Chardonnay we can recommend.",81,9.0,Molina
69590,New Zealand,"An eccentric version of Marlborough Riesling that tastes reminiscent of Marlborough Sauvignon Blanc, with a green, underripe quality and some goosberry aromas on the nose. There's also a hint of riper, cinnamon-scented fruit and a clean, crisp finish.",85,15.0,Marlborough

The palate is dry and slender but has real impact. The finish is long, fresh and aromatic.",93,26.0,Alsace
69593,US,"Soft, fruity and alcoholic, this Syrah tastes like a melted dessert pastry made of blackberry jam, chocolate-covered raisins, licorice and dark honey. While the tannins are beautiful, the wine feels hot and overripe.",84,45.0,California
69594,US,"Lots to admire in this Cab. It's bone dry and rich in blackberry and cedar flavors, with overtones of mocha, anise and toast, and is very tannic. Clearly made in a leaner style than today's high-alcohol cult style, it trades some richness for elegance and finesse. This is a wine that puts its bet on cellaring. Try after 2013.",93,75.0,California
69595,France,"On the rich side, this is a ripe and fruity wine. Its mineral texture is comfortably cushioned within an aromatic white fruit character that adds juicy acidity to the mix. It's a delicious wine that could age a few months more.",89,20.0,Alsace
69596,US,"This is proof that excellent Chardonnay can come from this warm region in Southern California. Key lime pie, peach blossom and shaved apple aromas show on the nose.

69597,US,"A few years in the bottle have nicely mellowed this wine, giving it a soft, smooth mouthfeel. The flavors are of cherries, red and black, perfectly ripe, seasoned with cassis and smoky new oak. Dry and elegant, this Merlot should hold well for five years.",88,26.0,California

69600,US,"In a good vintage, which 2009 was, Silverado's Solo bottling is always worthy of aging. It would be a tragedy to open this 100% Cabernet before 2018, and even then it might be too early.

69601,US,"Almost half Merlot with the rest Cabernet Sauvignon with just a dollop of Cabernet Franc (9%) added to the mix, it brings notes of cocoa, plum, green herbs and bell pepper. Lighter in color and feel, it's made in an elegant style with a pleasing sense of freshness.",85,14.0,Oregon

69607,US,"From three different sites, all within Green Valley, this is a block and barrel selection, a showcase of rich, ripe, robust baked black cherry and full-bodied gusto. The oak is tenacious and in support of the more delicate nuances of compost and rose.",89,68.0,California
69608,US,"This wine is heady in apple blossom and jasmine, deeply honeyed in color with an accompanying taste of honey and apple.

69614,US,"This vineyard is often featured in designate bottlings from some of Oregon's best producers. Here the black fruits impress immediately, with dense and powerful black cherry and cassis flavors. At first tight and slightly chalky, this wine responds very well to aggressive aeration, and the AVA's typical minerality emerges.",91,65.0,Oregon

69735,US,"This is the first Chardonnay for Daedalus Cellars. Flavors are rich and full-bodied, with candied orange peel, sweet citrus and vanilla most noticeable among them. Left on the lees for almost 18 months, this is wide open and ready to drink.",87,25.0,Oregon
69736,US,"A rich, fruity wine with explosive blackberry and cherry jam, black currant, spicy plum and smoky cedar flavors. Direct and obvious now, but could develop bottle complexity over the next 4–6 years.",87,40.0,California
69737,Italy,"Aromas of ripe, dark fruit, tilled earth, game and oak-driven spice lead the nose on this blend of Sangiovese and 15% Merlot. On the palate, vanilla, oak, licorice and espresso accent a core of black cherry while fine-grained tannins provide support.",89,26.0,Tuscany

The winemakers and owners are the husband and wife team from Mount Veeder's Lagier-Meredith.",91,35.0,California
69744,Chile,"Cherry and berry aromas are basic and just good enough. This smacks down hard in the mouth with acidity, while flavors of tomato, red plum and medicinal berry end short and without a lot of substance.",84,17.0,Limarí Valley
69745,France,"Plenty of ripe fruit and big texture on this intense wine, which hasn't shown half its potential yet. The pear and white peach fruits are edged with minerality and a closed-in texture. The wood gives an unfortunate burnt edge that needs to soften out. Age for at least five years.",93,,Burgundy
69746,US,"This is a shockingly low price for anything from Rutherford, let alone Cabernet Sauvignon, but sometimes why ask why? Dusty and powerful, it's well balanced in acidity and black fruit, finishing in leather and dark chocolate bound by leather.",88,15.0,California
69747,Germany,"Kirsten's Feinherb, or gently sweet bottling, maintains a firm foundation of stoniness, but also embraces softer, less angular dimensions of spring blossom and peach. High-toned acidity brighten and lifts the palate through a long finish. Drink now through 2021.",90,22.0,Mosel

69758,France,This very earthy wine with a barnyard character has lost its fruit. It does have structure but it is not likely to lose its animal edge.,84,,Burgundy
69759,US,"Made in a drier, more elegant style than many other Napa Cabs, this polished bottling can be described as Bordeaux-esque. Its blackberry and currant flavors are grounded in a cedary structure of earth and herbs. Great for a wine list. Drink this fine wine now and through 2014.",92,65.0,California

69765,US,"Gallo has held this Chard more than 4 years before release; the reason may be an acidic tightness that still dominates the wine. It's deep in mineral-infused apricot and quince fruit. The barrel regimen consisted of 100% new oak. It's a big, absolutely dry, almost rasping wine, and may be one of those rare California Chards capable of aging. See what it does after 2008.",90,50.0,California
69766,US,"This bears a silky texture that's light and pleasant on the palate, but there's nothing light about the flavors.

Drink now through 2025.",94,52.0,Oregon
69773,US,"This wine all comes from Watermill Vineyard down in the Rocks District. Seeing only 27% new French oak, it rises up from the glass with appealing aromas of orange peel, moist earth, ember, herb and smoked meat, along with wisps of black olive.

69779,US,"Beautifully aromatic, this purple-hued wine offers generous plum and black cherry flavors that are cloaked in mocha, with muscular, earthy tannins.

69785,US,"Full bodied and gritty in texture, this wine smooths out in the glass, opening to slowly unravel layers of forest pine, black cherry and cola. With measured oak, it has a depth and breadth across the palate, revealing concentration within a graceful context.",91,65.0,California

69796,US,"This wine remains astringent in tannins, with a lockded-down mouthfeel that's hard to get past. But it's very rich in blackberry and cherry fruit. Is it worth aging?

69800,France,"This is not an obvious wine, but one that creeps up slowly, takes time and impresses quietly. It delivers depth rather than power.

69813,US,"All estate-grown, this beautifully crafted Cabernet is a fine expression of Columbia Valley fruit. It's lifted with juicy berry and black cherry flavors, then expanded with notes of cola, earth, leaf, herb and roasted coffee.

69817,Chile,"The bouquet is fairly exotic as it kicks up some cinnamon and forest floor. But there's also some lemony oak that doesn't really fit in.

69818,US,"A blend of 58% Syrah, 38% Cabernet Sauvignon and 4% Mourvèdre, this combinins power with a big yum factor. Potent and rich, with woody, spicy highlights, the juicy fruit flavors favor blackberry and black cherry. A whiff of smoke runs through the finish.",92,37.0,Washington

Tasted twice, with consistent results.",94,125.0,California

69964,Germany,"An interesting example of dry Riesling, one that displays a dense, honeyed bouquet and flavors that resemble honey but without the sweetness.

70063,France,"This ripe, concentrated wine brings out the fruit of the vintage, ripe blackberries and currants. Tannins integrate well into the fruity character of the wine. Black cherry acidity comes through strongly at the end.",88,35.0,Bordeaux
70064,US,"This 100% Cabernet tastes way too oaky. Vanilla cream and caramel dominate the blackberries and black currants, giving it a woody sweetness. The question is, will it age out? The classic answer is that a wine that tastes unbalanced when young most likely always will.",84,65.0,California
70065,US,"At four-plus years of age, this single-vineyard Syrah still has babyfat flavors of blackberry jam, cassis, red currants, licorice, cola, Asian spice and smoky oak that are fresh and vibrant. It's lovely now, with a rich texture of finely-ground tannins, but should develop additional complexity with another five years in the cellar.",92,37.0,California
70066,US,"All five Bordeaux varieties are represented in this wine that leads with light aromas of raspberry, cola and medicine cabinet. The blue fruit flavors are quite sweet, with chalky tannins providing support.",87,20.0,Washington
70067,US,"Made from three selections of Pinot Noir and aged in one-year-old barrels, this is a forward Pinot Noir, rich in raspberries, cherries, spicy bacon and smoky sandalwood flavors. It's a dazzler, and best now for its youthful appeal.",92,42.0,California

70072,France,"A stalky wine, it displays some juicy fruits alongside the dry wood flavors. It is balanced, with black currant juiciness along with a lightweight texture. Not for long aging, the wine should be drunk from 2016.",85,,Bordeaux
70073,US,"This wine is sourced from Griffin's Lair, Sun Chase Vineyard and Terra de Promissio—three sites cooled by the coast. Candied and perfumed with robust oak and pine, it shows dark red fruit and supportive tannin, with a richness that remains balanced and fresh.",92,46.0,California
70074,France,"Fruity wine, wild strawberry flavors that are cut through with juicy acidity. Touches of wood support the soft, ripe tannins of this structured, generous wine. Age for 3–4 years.",89,42.0,Loire Valley

70078,US,"Winemaker Isabelle Meunier (ex-Evening Land) has carefully selected a handful of sites for her first release of single-vineyard wines under this new label. This is perhaps the most elegant, with exceptional texture, color and overall finesse. Fruits are delicate and detailed, showing watermelon, salmonberry, strawberry and a bit of spice. The 30% new French oak aging adds a gentle kiss of cocoa. Drink now to 2030 and beyond.",92,65.0,Oregon
70079,Chile,"This is a vegetal SB, no two ways about it. Aromas of canned beans and peas are greener than Ireland. Flavors of asparagus, canned peas and citrus finish soft, with low acidity.",82,13.0,Elqui Valley
70080,US,"From the famous class of ‘99 Cabs, a softly rich, voluptuous wine, brimming with cassis and blackcurrant flavors generously framed in oak. Lacks a bit of stuffing and complexity, but on the surface, tasty stuff.",88,45.0,California
70081,US,"A very distinctive 100% Cab that some might even find controversial. It's ripe almost to the point of supermaturity, showing powerful currant and licorice flavors that are very well oaked. Finishes hard in tannins in its youth. Aims, with some success, at an extracted, modern or cult style.",88,56.0,California
70082,US,"A dry, slightly herbal Chardonnay, with oak-inspired pear, peach and pineapple flavors. Feels elegant and sophisticated. Drink now.",88,40.0,California
70083,US,"This is a heady wine from Mike Sinor, with blackberry and blueberry fruit aromas that are enhanced by clove, nutmeg, cinnamon, candied lilacs and loamy soil scents.

70084,France,"As with several wines from Bourg, this has Malbec (20%) in the blend, a continuation of a long tradition. It adds maybe some extra tannins to this firm wine that is the chateau's top wine. Solid and dense, it is still maturing with black fruits and crisp acidity still right up front. Drink from 2018.",88,13.0,Bordeaux
70085,Australia,"From a reliable Clare Valley producer, Pikes 2006 Dry Riesling appears to be an ageworthy effort, boasting plenty of crisp intensity.

70087,Italy,"Altrovino is a 50-50 blend of Merlot and Cabernet Franc that opens with intense aromas of black fruit, spice, tobacco and smooth black chocolate. In the mouth, this wine offers richness and a silky, long finish.",88,40.0,Tuscany
70088,US,"This has a noticeable scent of tackroom leather that carries into the flavors, somewhat muting the black-cherry fruit. For such a young wine it is already on the way to drying out. Some interesting accents of pipe tobacco, smoke and coffee run through the finish. It's now at its best, so drink up.",87,22.0,Oregon
70089,US,"A good red wine that does just what Merlot is supposed to do, be enjoyable now. It's softly fruity and immediately likeable, with pleasant cherry pie, blackberry, cocoa and sandalwood flavors.",87,30.0,California
70090,US,"Block 23 is all Pommard clone. At first the drying, tea-flavored tannins push the fruit down, but over many hours the wine expands with generous flavors of cherry fruit leather, candied orange peel, and polished tannins.",93,60.0,Oregon
70091,Chile,"While this smells plump, mealy and soft, it's decidedly acidic and citrusy in the mouth. In terms of feel, it's limited and monotone, while the flavors run toward vanilla, orange and oak. The finish is fleeting finish and light on flavor.",82,30.0,Limarí Valley
70092,US,"Lean and rich at the same time, this wine offers a brightness of citrus and pear at the entry. The midpalate becomes heavier in oak and ripe in tropical flavor.",87,32.0,California
70093,Chile,"Simple, regular peach and pear aromas lead to a palate of sweet apple flavor and mild citric bite. This is the ultimate in basic Chilean Chardonnay: it's clean, a little dull and melony, and sweet. Drink soon.",84,10.0,Central Valley
70094,US,"This blend of Zin, Petite Sirah and Mourvèdre is sort of old fashioned, a dark, full-bodied wine whose berry fruitiness has an earthy, balsamic vinegar edge. It's tannic and slightly sweet.",84,17.0,California
70095,US,"The honey and orange aromas, rich texture, full body and late-harvest flavors add up to a bold and fruity wine. With each sip, more complexity and depth comes out, making a lasting impression.",89,13.0,California

70097,France,"This wine is dry, dominated by the new-wood flavors and toasty character that hide any fruit. The lean structure will probably remain. The property is owned by the Kressmann family.",86,30.0,Bordeaux
70098,France,"Steinbach is a village at the extreme southern end of the Alsace vineyard, known for its Pinot Noir. This is a rich, full example—a wine that has structure and concentration, as well as ripe cherry fruitiness. It can be drunk now, or until 2022.",90,35.0,Alsace
70099,US,"Soft and awkward, with dull berry flavors that have a vegetal tinge.",80,18.0,California
70100,US,"Not many wineries hold back Syrah this long, but it must have been because the wine was so tannic. It's still pretty tannic and dry. But there's enough sweet blackberry, currant and cherry fruit to satisfy, especially with char-broiled beef.",85,20.0,California
70101,France,"88-90 Barrel sample. A dark hued wine, with its tense tannins giving a strong backbone to the dry, firm structure. The fruit hardly shows through all this dry, extracted character.",89,,Bordeaux
70102,US,"Pressed directly to barrel prior to fermentation, it's dusty and fragrant, capturing the higher acidity of the vintage, and some underlying minerality. This 2008 does not have the ripe peachiness of the previous year, but the citrus/pineapple fruit makes an excellent food wine, stylish and affordable.",89,18.0,Washington
70103,Italy,"Aromas of dark-skinned berry, moist earth and a balsamic note of menthol waft out of the glass. The tart, vibrant palate offers sour cherry and star anise framed in racy acidity and austere tannins.",87,32.0,Tuscany
70104,Chile,"Green bean and lettuce aromas run the tight, green nose straight into a lip-smacking, acidic palate with tart apple and green citrus flavors, i.e. lime. Crisp and acidic on the finish, with a minerally feel.",84,12.0,Limarí Valley
70105,US,"A very fine Cabernet Sauvignon, dry and classically structured. It's a big, full-bodied wine, with hefty tannins that effectively lock down intense flavors of blackberries, cassis, dark chocolate and minerals. Complex and dramatic, this beauty is clearly a cellar candidate. Give it 6–8 years.",94,65.0,California
70106,US,"This blend of Primitivo (43%), Petite Sirah (28%) and Zinfandel offers aromas of blackberry jam, plum, dried fruit and baking spices. It's full bodied and palate coating with high-octane fruit flavors that linger.",90,24.0,Washington
70107,Spain,"Gritty cherry and cranberry aromas and a bright red color announce a spunky, simple wine with little Cabernet character. Juicy and light-bodied, it conveys basic plum and cherry flavors.",83,5.0,Levante
70108,US,"This great-value SB from Lake County hits it out of the park on all sorts of fronts, including price. It's got subtle aromatics of pear and lemon, and is a little generic and simple, but at $10 it's so perfectly drinkable who cares? All in a colorful package. Best Buy.",87,10.0,California
70109,US,"Rued Ranch consistently is the winery's top bottling. The 2011, like its predecessors, is modest in alcohol but vast in citrus, tropical fruit, honeysuckle and mineral flavors, and enriched with smoky oak and buttery notes. It has a delicate mouthfeel that makes it a joy to savor.",95,50.0,California
70110,US,"This wine makes a big impression with wild, earthy aromas and dense, fruit-laden flavors. It blends ripe plum, smoke, tart blackberry and rich black cherry notes on a base of firm tannins and fresh acidity. These are rich, complex and carry through to the lingering finish. It's made from 85% Mourvèdre, plus Syrah, Grenache and Counoise.",90,32.0,California
70111,US,"Bold flavors and a muscular structure make this wine stand out, delivering plenty of substance for its modest price. Smoky, peppery aromas lead to dark fruit flavors with smoky, spicy accents, while the body is medium and texture firmly tannic.",88,10.0,California
70112,Austria,"An unusual but alluring perfume of boxwood and spicy grapefruit zest rises from the glass. The palate follows on light feet, with a delicate, translucent body that shimmers in green citrus and spice tones. This wine is dry, light but totally intriguing, with a final note of pure lemon.",92,,Südsteiermark
70113,US,"Nice Cabernet flavors in this dry, softly appealing wine. Satisfies with waves of blackberries and black currants, touched with oak. Drink now, and easy to find, with 38,000 cases produced.",86,17.0,California
70114,US,"While initially subdued on the nose, this zesty citrus-kissed Riesling offers loads of lemon and lime vitality. It's crisp and light bodied with a finish that's dry and mineral.",89,26.0,New York

70117,US,"A delightful bottle of Sauvignon Blanc with notes of pink grapefruit, lime zest, and medley of fresh herbs. What the palate lacks in terms of fruit concentration it makes up for with a fine zip of acidity.",87,19.0,Oregon
70118,US,"Principally Cabernet Sauvignon, this blends in small amounts of Merlot, Cabernet Franc and Malbec. Broad fruit flavors range from strawberry into red plum, with some stemmy earth leading into stiff tannins. The astringent, earthy character is well-managed and balanced against the pretty fruit.",90,30.0,Washington
70119,US,"A streak of iron and mineral leads, with rich, ripe, dark fruit flavors following. Compact and tannic, this is extremely young. But compressed in the wine are complex streaks of herb and mineral. The tannins are strong and polished.",93,35.0,Washington
70120,US,"From the producer's younger hillside blocks, this is comprised of 93% Cabernet Sauvignon with smaller percents of Malbec and Merlot. Blackberry and cherry are warmly wrapped in a blanket of chocolate and clove, while easy acidity provides softness and approachability to the texture and body weight, which are voluptuous.",91,48.0,California
70121,Spain,"Jammy aromas of baked blackberry and plum are fiery at first and then flatten out with airing. A choppy palate offers a bumpy ride with ripe plum and berry flavors in front of a full-force, toasty finish that shows a strong grip courtesy of big tannins. This is two-thirds Garnacha with Syrah and Carignan.",88,23.0,Catalonia
70122,France,"This well-proportioned wine has ripe fruits along with generous texture and acidity. A touch of wood gives extra weight. It's ready to drink, but will be even better by the end of 2014.",91,20.0,Burgundy
70123,US,"This single-vineyard selection from the Jackson Family's Santa Maria Valley winery kicks off with scents ranging from red, blistered tomato to pomegranate reduction and mole sauce. On the palate, flavors vary from sweeter berry to tart cherry, with a savory, roasted pork element rounding out the wine.",91,25.0,California
70124,US,"This 100% varietal wine is made in a seemingly light-handed style, lean on the palate in graphite and tart cherry, with a diluted edge. It gains succulence in the glass, with a juicy overlay of tobacco and cinnamon-dusted raspberry.",88,54.0,California
70125,Italy,"Some lovely red wines are coming from the Montecucco wine region (located in coastal Tuscany) and Collemassari leads the pack of this new and exciting group of vintners. Soft cherry, leather, spice, and earthy mineral tones create harmony and momentum.",91,28.0,Tuscany
70126,Australia,"This Riesling's fruit is from a 70-year-old Eden Valley vineyard; half the wine was vinified by Jeff Grosset at Polish Hill, the other half was vinified by Rob Hill Smith at Yalumba. Once the wine was all brought together, Grosset and Hill-Smith, as the story goes, took four days to decide on the final blend. The wine's at once viscous and very dry, with stone fruit, vanilla bean and some floral flavors. Green apple rounds out the long, dry finsih.",89,25.0,South Australia
70127,Italy,"Spicy, structured and fruity, this savory wine opens with aromas of ripe berry and dark cooking spice. The full-bodied palate doles out crushed blackberry, plum, black cherry, ground black pepper and star anise alongside firm, velvety tannins.",90,30.0,Sicily & Sardinia
70128,France,"This wine is ripe, jammy and full of juicy red fruits supported by tannins. The wine is still young, with its bright fruit very much to the fore. Let it round out before drinking, so wait until 2018.",85,20.0,Loire Valley
70129,US,"There is already a hint of tawniness to this wine (second bottle— first was TCA-infected) that suggests a short life ahead. It's charming at the moment, surprisingly far along the aging curve, but with pretty cherry fruit and some sandalwood in the tannins. Drink up.",85,24.0,Oregon
70130,US,"Bone dry and tart in citrusy acidity, this is a Chablis-style Chardonnay. It has a firm minerality grounding clean flavors of sour pineapple candy, with richer notes of vanilla and smoky oak. Elegant and food-friendly.",89,19.0,California
70131,US,"Too ripe and too oaky, and both attributes reinforce each other. The blackberry and currant fruit approaches Port in raisiny ripeness, while the oak accentuates the tannic sweetness. Clumsy now, but sometimes these wines improve in the long run. Try holding until after 2013.",86,150.0,California
70132,US,"A quick extraction yielded a pale peach color for this Vin Gris made from Cabernet Franc, Cabernet Sauvignon and Petit Verdot. Delicate aromas of candied banana and peach lead to a palate driven by pink grapefruit.",85,18.0,Virginia
70133,France,"This is a perfumed, fruity wine. Along with its fresh acidity, crisp apple texture and touches of lemon, it offers a tang of orange zest as well as touches of minerality from the gravelly soil of the vineyard. Drink now.",86,25.0,Loire Valley

70135,US,"The vineyard has been source to Pinot Noirs from Copain and Drew, and this one, from Winemaker Jon Grant shows a somewhat Cabernet-esque interpretation. The wine is dark, tannic and medium-bodied, and quite extracted in the flashily ripe cherry and cola fruit that Monument Tree ripens so well in a cool, long hangtime year like 2010. Despite the richness, this is an elegant, ageworthy wine, whose low alcohol will delight many who critique California Pinot Noir for clumsiness. Give it at least six years in a good cellar.",94,38.0,California
70136,US,"A strong effort from Olsen Estates, this 100% Syrah has fine varietal character, in a rough and tumble style. Cured meats, herbs, earth and hints of sea salt mingle with the wild berry fruit flavors. It's balanced and fresh, with lingering and nuanced flavors threading through the gulpable finish.",92,29.0,Washington
70137,US,"Exceptionally sheer and crisp, Wölffer's standard-label rosé offers plenty of crisp-tart sour-cherry flavor along with herb and bramble notes. Made predominantly from Merlot and Chardonnay, it gains extra oomph from a supporting cast of four other red and white grape varieties.",88,18.0,New York
70138,Chile,"Even if this Cab shows eucalyptus on the nose along with asphalt and olive aromas, the bouquet is complex and true as far as high-end Chilean Cabs go. A saturated, syrupy body reflects a hot vintage, while baked flavors of earthy fruits, beef soup and chocolate qualify as stewy but tasty. A warm, flat finish says drink this Cabernet sooner rather than later.",90,60.0,Maipo Valley
70139,US,"A deep rose color, this pretty wine seduces with sweet cherry and red plum fruit, rounded out with a dollop of cinnamon spice and buoyed with moderate acidity. Full, forward, flavorful and built for medium-term aging, this should be enjoyed now through 2020.",92,50.0,Oregon
70140,France,"Very classic in style, it has firm tannins that come before black currant fruits. Its structure is dry, lightly smoky from wood aging and with a crisper fruit character underneath. The tannins need to soften before the wine can be drunk with pleasure, so wait until 2017.",87,25.0,Bordeaux
70141,US,"An average, everyday Cabernet, okay for the price. It's soft and a little sweet, with sugared blackberry tea flavors.",83,15.0,California
70142,US,"This wine offers very ripe and vivid fruit in the aromas and the flavors, like blackberries and dark plums picked when they're just beginning to shrivel. The texture is broad and the body full, but the tannins and acidity feel low, so the wine's personality is both big and soft.",88,50.0,California
70143,France,"The hard limestone and chalk soil has given this wine its distinctive minerality and wonderful acidity. Rich and juicy, it has intense yellow and green fruits that are laced with lime acidity. The wine has depth with concentrated fruitiness. Drink from 2017.",92,40.0,Loire Valley
70144,US,"This wine from the heart of the appellation is woody with cedar and sage notes, its leathery texture defined by firm tannins.

70145,US,"Cabernet Sauvignon makes up just over two-thirds of this wine with the balance Merlot, Malbec, Cabernet Franc and Petit Verdot. Dried herb, black cherry, licorice and spice aromas lead to full-feeling dark fruit flavors that show intensity and persistence.",91,49.0,Washington
70146,US,"Dry Creek Chards ask for a certain indulgence. They're never opulent or over the top, and have rather earthy flavors that bring to mind sweet, cured tobacco. This wine, which is a fine example, features winemaker interventions, like lees and oak, and finishes with some tannins. If you're adventurous, try aging it.",87,30.0,California
70147,US,"Sierra Foothills-based La Folia specializes in Cal-Ital varieties. This super Tuscan-style blend of 75% Cabernet Sauvignon and 25% Sangiovese, aged in entirely new French oak, is impressively resplendent in coconut, sour cherry and ripe plum notes, with a softness that makes it remarkably drinkable. This bright wine will pair magnificently with all kinds of pizza and pasta.",89,40.0,California

70149,New Zealand,"Winemaker Alana McGettigan is an associate of Matt Thomson (Saint Clair, Delta), so it's no surprise this Sauvignon Blanc overdelivers. Hints of tomato leaf garnish passion fruit and citrus flavors in this wine, which reveals a certain amount of austerity and restraint on the palate, a silky texture and a long, grapefruit-driven finish.",90,14.0,Marlborough
70150,US,"Pomegranate aromas on the fairly tight nose of this wine combine with sandalwood, hibiscus tang and minerality. It's tight, bright and rocky on the palate, with chipped slate flavors providing an earthy backbone to the cranberry fruit.",91,48.0,California
70151,France,"This is laden with wood, spiced with a toast note that dominates this otherwise crisp, nervy wine. The acidity is refreshing; the citrus note creates a lively streak of freshness. This needs a few months for the wood infuence to soften.",86,,Burgundy
70152,US,"In this inaugural release, winemaker James MacPhail travels to the far reaches of Annapolis to source grapes from the true wilderness, the site next door to Goldrock Ridge Vineyard. Made in a full-bodied style, this wine is intriguing in dried herb, black pepper and forest floor, with a healthy, lengthy seasoning of savory black tea.",92,65.0,California
70153,US,"Impressive and elegant, this one leans American with its R & B name and packaging, but is rather French in profile. The black-cherry fruit is offset by a lead-pencil element reminiscent of some top Bordeaux chateaus. Angular and fairly crisp, it shows coffee accents and a fairly long finish. If it adds some weight with age, it will drink above the present rating.",90,74.0,California
70154,France,"Clean notes of apple, melon and lime peel unfold of the nose and carry through to the lightweight mouth. There's ample acidity to keep the palate fresh, with a short finish.",84,16.0,Languedoc-Roussillon
70155,France,This branded Bordeaux is packed both with fruit and with a firm structure. It has a dense texture and solid tannins although the generous fruit will allow it to age relatively quickly. Drink from 2018.,87,17.0,Bordeaux
70156,US,"Quite yellow in the glass, this bottling shows cohesive and familiar aromas of buttered toast, jasmine, orange marmalade, sandalwood and smoke on the nose. The palate packs lemon and butter together with walnut oil, proving quite rich and even heavy at times.",88,28.0,California
70157,US,"This older vintage Chardonnay has a flinty, saline quality to it and a faint taste of waxy apple. Medium in body, it's savory and surrounded by citrus tones with a high note of acidity. Clean and integrated it's a nice reminder of how Chardonnay can be just as fresh and alive five years on as upon first release.",88,39.0,California
70158,US,"This wine needs some coaxing at first to come out of its shell. Once settled, it entices in warming cardamom, clove and damp earth, taking on savory airs. Exuberant as it develops, it offers high-toned cherry and tangerine that surround a silky, subtle body. Hints of spicy cinnamon and white pepper mark the finish.",93,70.0,California
70159,Italy,"Purple flower, dark-skinned berry and brown spice aromas lead the nose of this young wine. The straightforward palate shows dried black cherry, powdered sage and a hint of espresso with lithe tannins. Drink soon.",88,23.0,Tuscany

70163,US,"This site continues to wow, especially when featured by this grower-producer. Light, bright and lemony in initial aroma and flavor, it develops additional complexity and nuance in the glass, alighting in apple crumble, anise and mouthfilling succulence, the minerality well defined and vibrantly fresh.",94,70.0,California
70164,Spain,"From the Frutos Villar bodega comes this friendly if a bit lean reserva with cherry, leather, and rubber aromas and a snappy, clean palate of cherry and raspberry fruit.

70165,US,"It's soft and gentle in texture, yet richly tannic, with complex blackberry, black currant, herb and cedar flavors. It shows the classic elegance that's characteristic of this mountain vineyard site. Drink over the next 3–4 years.",91,75.0,California

Crisp melon rind and grapefruit flavors fill out the midpalate, finishing on a long, lingering slick of honey and subtle cashew notes. Lovely now, but likely to intensify well into the 2020's.",90,49.0,Nahe
70171,Australia,"Green beans and grapefruit mark the nose; nectarine, pineapple and beans appear on the palate. At just 12.6% abv, it's reasonably plump and a bit sweet-tasting, making for a slightly disjointed package.",85,13.0,South Australia
70172,France,"This impressive wine follows a straight line of structure, acidity, firm tannins and dark black fruits. The combination is a wine with depth, ripeness and an edge of austerity that demands aging. Drink from 2018.",92,,Bordeaux
70173,Portugal,"Pale red in color, this fruity rosé was one of the originals in the current pink Vinho Verde trend. It is still one of the best. It has a lively, ripe strawberry note accompanied by a touch of caramel and bright acidity.",86,10.0,Vinho Verde
70174,US,"Strong and ripe and oaky. Not showing much subtlety, but a very good example of the modern California style. It's a clean, vibrant Chardonnay starring massive flavors of pineapple tart, Meyer lemon custard and tangerines, brightened with zesty acidity.",87,30.0,California
70175,US,"There's tremendous black-fruit density present on the first whiff of the wine, with olallieberry jam and milk chocolate dusted with clove powder, yet also a graphite-driven lightness. The palate rides the line expertly between ripeness and tartness, with fresh boysenberry flavors and dried oregano, altogether excellently spiced.",93,48.0,California
70176,Italy,"A blend of 45% Cannonau, 45% Carignano and 10% Bovale Sardo, this opens with aromas of cassis, red cherry and Mediterranean scrub. The round juicy palate offers black plum, ripe raspberry and white pepper set against pliant tannins. Enjoy through 2019.",89,20.0,Sicily & Sardinia
70177,US,"A generations-old farming family on the North Fork, Harbes has been producing wines of increasing elegance and consistency in recent vintages. This Merlot-dominated blend of Syrah, Cabernet Franc and Petit Verdot is especially refined. A subtle sexy wine, it's redolent of ripe sunkissed blackberries spiced with coffee and anise. Full bodied yet tautly structured, it lingers on a crisp cranberry finish marked by feathery tannins.",90,43.0,New York
70178,New Zealand,"Not a typical New Zealand Riesling, but one worth trying for its bold, oily apricot and tangerine aromas and flavors that smell sweet but taste dry, ending in a stone-cold finish.",85,,Canterbury
70179,Argentina,"Was probably better a year or two ago; now it's losing steam and smelling and tasting oily and pithy. Aromas of almond skins denote old age, and while there's still vital acidity and leftover citrus flavors, it's fast approaching its deadline. Best to wait for the 2010, or even the 2011.",83,15.0,Mendoza Province
70180,Chile,"A pure and proper Cabernet with aromas of balsam wood, toast, berry and cassis. There's some power and kick on the palate, but the overall feel is good. So are the flavors of cassis, raspberry and plum. Spicy on the finish, with a bit of piquant heat.",88,12.0,Maipo Valley
70181,US,"This is a very full and deep wine, with aromas of black plum, mulberry, Dr Pepper, mint-chocolate chip and purple flowers. It's hearty on the palate as well, with black tea and rose petals showing alongside thick, rich mulberry, clove and baking spice galore. It's not dainty at all.",92,50.0,California
70182,US,"Very light in color in the glass, this appellation blend shows cut nectarine, lemon juice and apple skins on the easy, restrained but energetic nose. The palate offers touches of Pink Lady apple, nectarine and squeezed tangerine. It's altogether crisp and refreshing while retaining the grape's familiar notes.",89,45.0,California
70183,US,"Widely distributed and often praised, this seems a bit off-kilter this vintage. It delivers light berry and rhubarb fruit but also a hint of plastic and little sense of depth or flavor that go beyond basic red wine.",86,20.0,Oregon
70184,France,"This is a rich stylish wine from the Chanfreau family. It has fine tannins and signs of wood aging, both of which will meld into the juicy black-currant fruits. It has a predominance of Cabernet Sauvignon that gives the wine its structure and aging potential. The aftertaste is ripe and still crisp, still young. Drink from 2020.",92,29.0,Bordeaux
70185,Germany,"Richly textured and bursting with fresh yellow peach, nectarine and melon flavors, this is an elegant wine with wide appeal. Just slightly off dry in style, it's balanced by fresh acidity and a subtle mineral undertone. The finish lingers nicely. Drink now through 2019.",89,17.0,Mosel
70186,US,"You can almost taste the stones in this gentle, complex, delicate wine. Beyond the minerality are layers of raspberry tart, cherry cola, orange zest, white pepper and sandalwood. This lovely wine is beautiful now after decanting, and will age effortlessly for at least 10 years.",94,55.0,California
70187,US,"A tart, tight expression that is mostly varietal, with additions of Cabernet Franc and Merlot, this wine was given 30 months in French oak. Soft, integrated tannins wrap around a strong sense of tangy cranberry, finishing lean.",87,50.0,California
70188,US,"Co-fermented Syrah, Petite Sirah and Zinfandel from the Mounts Vineyard in Dry Creek Valley were all picked the same day for this blend that's tight, sinewy and smoky in sanguine notes of baked plum, cranberry and baked bread. It comes together in a softly layered package, drinking well now.",92,38.0,California
70189,Portugal,"The perfumes are the central theme of this wine, aromas of roses and flavors of spice, cinnamon, going through the ripe fruit and suggestions of wood. It is a superripe wine, but one which manages to keep in balance.",89,20.0,Alentejano
70190,US,"Possessing intensely floral aromatics, this distinctive wine also pulls in Asian spices, specifically curry. The fruit hangs on the light side of the red spectrum, with a dash of cherry candy.",87,29.0,Oregon
70191,US,"A unique blend of Syrah, Barbera, Malbec, Petit Verdot and Mourvèdre all aged in neutral oak, it's a straightforward, easy drinker with sweet notes of plum, cracked pepper and tire rubber.",85,16.0,Washington
70192,Slovenia,"Notes of mint and thyme add savory tones to bright, pristine flavors of cassis and black cherry in this blend of Merlot, Pinot Noir and Cabernet Sauvignon. Structured and full bodied, this has warm oak tones and striking acidity. It's delicious now, but it should continue to develop over the next five years.",91,50.0,Brda
70193,US,"Even if winemaker Jason Lett tripled the price of this wine, it would still be a standout among its peers. This opens with intense aromatics of pineapple fruit, bracing acidity and compelling length. On the second and third day after opening, it remained quite fresh and expressive, with further details of fruit and mineral beginning to emerge. Drink now through 2035.",96,27.0,Oregon
70194,US,"They pulled out all the stops on this white Burgundy-inspired Chard. It tastes quite leesy, with a Champagne-like yeastiness riding over the tropical fruit and oaky, caramelized flavors. Complex and intriguing, this unfined, unfiltered Chard should drink well for the next few years.",90,45.0,California
70195,US,"This is a young wine that needs cellaring to come around. Right now, it's tough in tannins, and the fruit is direct and primary. It really needs the alchemy of time for the wood, acids, tannins and flavors to come around. Give it three or four years for the black currants to marry with the cedar and become smoky-sweet.",92,86.0,California
70196,US,"Cooked black cherry, black soil and a pinch of pine sap combine for an intriguing nose on this clonal study. The flavors are clove-driven around a pomegranate-cherry backdrop, with a touch of cola and expertly balanced tannins and acidity.",92,55.0,California
70197,Italy,"Aromatic accents here include apple cider, chocolate and cherry. The wine has personality but sings out of tune in places, although it could work well with easy pasta or meat dishes. This expression of the wine has 80% Negroamaro and 20% Malvasia Nera.",85,14.0,Southern Italy
70198,US,"Very lively and jumpy, with bright cherry fruit supported by high-voltage acidity. It hits the high notes, but lacks the bass below, and therefore is ultimately a bit out of balance. Very much a cherry-fruit dominated, one-dimensional wine",84,12.0,Oregon
70199,Chile,"Plum, tomato and animal aromas feed into a tight, pulling, tannic palate. Salty and savory plum and berry flavors end with dry tannins and an overall scratchy feel that's rugged but stout.",86,17.0,Cachapoal Valley
70200,France,"This starts off as a deceptively simple berry-cocktail sort of rosé, but then adds lime and crushed stone on the finish to provide added interest and refreshment. Drink now.",87,10.0,Rhône Valley
70201,US,"Graham cracker and lemon aromas weave into the brioche and porcini undertones. Graceful in weight, this bears a frothy bead that lends the palate tension. Aged on lees for 36 months.",87,35.0,Virginia
70202,US,"If you liked the winery's far more expensive “1772” bottling of Syrah, you'll find an approximation of it here, at about half the price. Dry and balanced, with typical Edna Valley acidity, it's marked by black cherry, red currant, licorice, chocolate-covered mint and peppery spice flavors.",86,22.0,California
70203,US,"This shows Merry Edwards' signature of exceptional deliciousness and drinkability, coupled with seemingly neverending depth. Made using fruit sourced from the winery's vineyard in the cooler southwestern part of the valley, near Sebastopol, this is rich in acids and soft tannins, but the flavors set it apart. Notes of raspberry, cherry, cola, tea, licorice, pepper and sandalwood abound and evolve with every sip. Drink now–2018.",95,60.0,California
70204,US,"Some raspberry fruit in the aroma, but things turn rapidly earthy and herbal, suggesting dried tomato, rhubarb and oregano. The flavors are simple and uninspiring. Soft, mild, rustic and thin are other words that come to mind.",82,10.0,California
70205,South Africa,"Here's a well balanced and easy to drink value priced Sauv Blanc, offering notes of sweet grass, barely ripe peach and melon on the nose and mouth. Perfect for summer entertaining; pair with sushi or cocktail shrimp.",85,9.0,Robertson
70206,France,"This perfumed wine has a rustic edge that should blow away as the wine matures. For the fruit, it is red-berry time: bright, soft and lifted by gentle tannins and lively acidity. The wine will improve for a few more months, so drink from late 2017.",87,28.0,Loire Valley
70207,Germany,"Nervous lemon-lime acidity forms a strident spine to this dry, delicately framed Riesling. Tart white peach and pineapple flavors are concentrated yet crisp, leading a long mineral finish.",88,37.0,Pfalz
70208,US,"This is a dynamic wine, showing Key lime, yellow apples, oak smoke, butter, tangerine pith, macadamia nut and sea salt on the nose. The palate is streamlined with lime pith, lemon rind and seared pineapple flavors.",93,48.0,California
70209,US,"There's a damp earth character on the nose of this bottling, with mushroom, black raspberry, boysenberry and dill aromas. The palate coincides, with thyme, elderberry, pine and thick tart flavors.",87,52.0,California
70210,Germany,"Upfront aromas of smoke and spring ramps subside to reveal delicate apple blossom notes on this honeyed, medium-sweet wine. Ripe, rich yellow peach and cantaloupe flavors flood the palate, yet wrap up remarkably dry with a lingering finish that's intense with minerality. It's gorgeously styled, yet elegant and dainty.",91,42.0,Mosel
70211,US,"This blend of Cabernet Sauvignon, Cabernet Franc and Merlot saw just a kiss (15%) of new French oak, putting the fruit aromas of plum, blueberry, cherry and herb at the fore. The coffee and berry flavors are lighter in style backed by a firm squeeze of slightly gritty tannins.",90,28.0,Washington
70212,Australia,"This medium-bodied Chardonnay is more restrained than the 2013, but still offers plenty of roasted-cashew toastiness combined with hints of pineapple and guava. The finish is clean and refreshing, but doesn't show the hoped-for length, so drink this over the near term.",90,200.0,Western Australia
70213,France,"Firmly tannic wine, with balancing ripe fruit well under the structured layers. The weight of the wine comes from the rich and generous black plum fruit and acidity. A wine for long-term aging.",93,146.0,Burgundy
70214,US,"Here's a big, powerful, juicy young Pinot Noir that precisely shows the terroir of Santa Lucia Highlands and Garys' Vineyard, as well as the qualities of the vintage. The wine is massive in ripe black cherry, black raspberry, currant, cola, licorice and mocha flavors. As big as it is, it retains an elegant silkiness. Should slowly develop over many years.",94,50.0,California
70215,Austria,"A touch of flinty smoke hovers above the glass and clouds other varietal aromas of citrus and fern that find ready expression on the dry, fresh palate. The slender body still has some smoky edges, defined freshness and a clean-cut finish.",90,19.0,Südsteiermark
70216,US,"Very ripe, rich and fruity, showing powerful blackberry, cassis and cedar flavors. The structure is classic Napa, with firm, dynamic tannins and a fine application of acidity. Feels just great in the mouth, if on the young side. Give this wine three or four years in the cellar.",90,55.0,California
70217,France,"Ripe and full bodied, this is a wine that reflects the softness of the vintage. Aged in wood, it has a rounded texture, with spice, apricot and pineapple flavors, finishing with a touch of acidity.",88,30.0,Burgundy
70218,US,"This reserve-level wine shows extra concentration, though it comes with a slightly chalky mouthfeel. Raspberry and cherry fruit flavors are set against stiff, drying acids, and seem a bit blocky. Think of it as a chunky style of Pinot Noir, and pair it with a fat-inflected filet of wild caught salmon.",89,38.0,Oregon
70219,France,"Accurate varietal character abounds in this value red. There’s dark berry and a slight herbaceousness, but not in an off-putting way. Light in style but it possesses nice mouthfeel with smooth cassis fruit and a decent finish.",85,7.0,Languedoc-Roussillon
70220,US,"Concentrated blackberry and blueberry flavors are lifted by hints of fennel and smoke on the nose of this bottling. The first impression on the palate is thick cherry syrup, but a definitive structure and prominent acidity emerge to brighten the experience.",86,26.0,California
70221,US,"From Draper clone vines planted in 1965, this bright gold-hued wine brings myriad details to its apple, jicama, white peach and nut oil flavors. A whiff of smoke carries throughout, and its sheer complexity strains the vocabulary. Stay with it as more subtle layers unfold. Though seductive now, it should mature well through 2030.",95,60.0,Oregon
70222,US,"Cola and red-cherry aromas grow more complex with touches of rose, nori wrapper and purple flowers on the nose of this bottling. The mouthfeel is soft and the flavors are broad, with candied red cherry, rose petals and an elegant hibiscus-thyme tension, like an herb-laced fruit punch.",92,47.0,California
70223,US,"At 1.8% residual sugar, this estate-grown Riesling carries some definite sweetness, along with a tangy mix of lime, grapefruit and citrus peel. Leesy and textural, it puts the focus on citrus rather than floral flavors, and tails off in the finish.",88,15.0,Washington
70224,Italy,"This smooth, opulent meditation wine opens with aromas of acacia honey, cake spice and dried fruit. The honey note carries over to the enveloping palate along with notes of cinnamon and candied orange zest.",90,,Tuscany
70225,US,"The fermentation with the stems intact brings some earthy qualities front and center, to good effect. This is the most distinctive entry among the winery's eight Pinots, further enhanced by the use of wild yeasts. Scents of clover and hints of watercress and bark highlight the flavors of beetroot and brambly berry fruit. You will have fun playing this against a variety of potential food matchups.",91,85.0,Oregon
70226,US,"It's oaky, leesy and creamy, with buttered toast and caramel flavors dominating the pineapple fruit.",85,30.0,California
70227,US,"Talley's Rincon bottling is a big, complicated Pinot that's quite unresolved in youth. The 2006 is typical. Dark and full-bodied, it has opulent flavors of black currants, with tart notes of coffee and tobacco, and is completely dry. It's also quite tannic. Should come into its own after 2010 and glide for several more years.",92,58.0,California
70228,Italy,"This big simple red opens with aromas of black currant, cedar and a whiff of blue flower. The robust, one-dimensional palate shows raisin, prune and coffee alongside round, velvety tannins.",88,50.0,Veneto
70229,US,"Smoothly seductive in texture and body, this medium-sized vineyard designate is bright in lemon peel, vanilla and caramel apple flavors, see-sawing between richness and vibrancy. A mineral freshness emerges as it opens in the glass.",91,36.0,California
70230,France,"With signs of new wood on the palate, this is a wine that maintains the polished feel of the wines from Pichon Lalande. It has a stronger presence of Cabernet Sauvignon in the blend than in the past, making it more structured than its predecessors, with a dominance of black currant flavor. It shows the soft side of the vintage, but is also meant for aging.",96,,Bordeaux
70231,France,"There is obvious wood here, a toasty, dry character that shows through the fruit. The wine is young and with the sufficient weight of juicy black currant fruit, it should integrate well to give a solid, chunky wine in two years.",87,15.0,Bordeaux
70232,South Africa,"This is a Sauvignon Blanc with more meat and punch than the average white. The nose, crisp, clean and fresh but rounded, leads into a balanced, substantial wine with good acidity and an assertive mouthfeel. Elegant but has character. Could pair with richer dishes.",87,15.0,Constantia
70233,US,"Zesty acidity wraps itself around well-defined flavors of lemon and grapefruit in this mostly stainless-steel fermented white. The finish maintains the minerality, adding on a taste of fig.",88,24.0,California
70234,US,"As good as the winery's other 2008s are, this wine raises the stakes. It's bone dry, deeply tannic and marked by classic varietal flavors of blackberries, cassis and dark chocolate, with sweet, smoky oak. Almost a food group in itself for its complexity, it's dazzling now for its sheer luxurious deliciousness, yet is guaranteed to develop over at least the next 10 years.",98,125.0,California
70235,US,"Inky in the glass and thick on the nose with deep blueberry and concentrated violet petals, this bottling is a study of richness and extraction, and would grab anyone's attention in one whiff. Lavish flavors of blueberry and blackberry mesh with fudge, mocha and espresso on the palate, which hangs on extremely soft tannins and a boisterous acidity.",94,40.0,California
70236,France,"From the northern end of the Gevrey-Chambertin appellation, this wine is ripe, floral and supple in texture. It has crisp red fruit and vibrant acidity, underpinned by ripe tannins. Developing quickly, it will be ready to drink from 2019.",92,85.0,Burgundy

70238,Spain,"This is one of the few commercial bottlings coming out of Mallorca, and it's a unique wine made mostly from Callet, a native variety. Aromas of rose petals, strawberry and potpourri are exotic and unfamiliar. This crackles with acidity and delivers savory flavors of BBQ meat, earthy red fruits and molasses. Racy on the finish, this cries out for food; drink through 2016.",91,50.0,Spanish Islands
70239,US,"This 100% varietal wine from Lewis and Wallula vineyards beguiles with its aromas of vanilla bean, butterscotch, baking spice, cherry and cinnamon.

70240,Chile,"This crisp, acidic Sauvignon Blanc leans green with pea and canned bean aromas, but it offers enough green apple and citrus character for enjoyment.

70241,Argentina,"Slightly earthy and herbal smelling but with enough clean fruit on the nose to make the grade. The palate is fairly flush, with blackberry, baked notes and bitter chocolate flavors. Fleshy and warm overall, with a thick finish that's lightly peppery and toasty.",86,10.0,Mendoza Province
70242,US,"Light and clean in the nose, with attractive hints of nutmeg and other baking spices. It's certainly not dull, what with its fresh grapefruit, nectarine and tangerine flavors. A crisp, refreshing finish is the final act, making it perfect to accompany shellfish.",88,16.0,California

70244,France,"Importer Bobby Kacher seemingly has a pipeline to the best rosés around Nîmes, and Mas des Bressades is a perennial favorite. The 2008 features layers of ripe fruit--berries and peaches--brought together in a lush, full-bodied but not overblown wine. Drink now.",89,13.0,Rhône Valley

70246,Portugal,"This candied rosé is a blend of Touriga Nacional and Syrah. Full of soft red berry fruits with only light acidity, it is off-dry to taste. A touch of pepper at the end is less attractive.",83,9.0,Tejo
70247,Italy,"This gorgeous Chianti Classico boasts lively cherry, strawberry and violet aromas.

A textbook Chianti Classico.",93,16.0,Tuscany
70248,Israel,"Here's a fresh and lively unoaked Chard that's perfect for lighter fare like tabouleh salad or grilled chicken.

Flavorful and refreshing; drink now.",87,20.0,Judean Hills
70249,US,"Smoky notes of roasted meat and white pepper spice up the plum skins and blackberry fruit that show on the nose of this bottling.

70255,US,"Here's a firm young Cab that desperately needs time in the cellar. Its tannins push and shove the palate, stinging and shutting it down. But there's a deep core of terrifically ripe black currants, and the oak application is fancy. Only 150 cases produced. Best after 2011 and possibly for many years after.",94,120.0,California
70256,US,"This wine strikes a wide purple fruit note at first before centering on plum jam, wood smoke and a licorice element. On the palate, medium tannins frame a medium and smooth mouthfeel, with flavors of tobacco leaf giving way to richer coffee and woody elderberry flavors.",89,17.0,California

70265,US,"Baked black cherry and black plum meet with lots of crushed gravel and light fennel on the nose of this bottling that is all about fruit and earth, rather than herb and spice.

70267,France,"A light and fruity wine that is ready to drink. From the heart of the Entre-deux-Mers region, it has red berry fruits and juicy acidity. A greener, herbal character in the background suggests grapes that weren't totally ripe at harvest.",83,19.0,Bordeaux

70277,Austria,"Honey and the perfumed notes of quince are immediately apparent on this Spätlese Riesling. The sweetness is carried beautifully by ripe notions of peach, additional quince and apricot coulis, balanced and countered by the fresh, ripe and pliable acidity of oranges and tangerines. This is slightly decadent and very harmonious. Perhaps sweet enough for an apricot tart but certainly a killer with salty blue cheeses. No other grape can perform the same tightrope walk as Riesling. Enjoy.",91,29.0,Niederösterreich
70278,US,"The Deux Verres spreads broadly across the palate, soft and slightly soapy. The simple fruit is accented with earth and mushroom highlights. It quickly fades and leaves behind a pleasant herbal note on the finish.",87,35.0,Oregon
70279,Portugal,"This wine is all fruit. Its black-currant flavors and attractive acidity come from a blend that is dominated by Tinta Roriz, Touriga Franca and Tinta Barroca. It has minerality and a dry edge, although its fruitiness means it is ready to drink.",87,10.0,Douro
70280,US,"This wine is a blend of Cabernet Franc (42%), Merlot (41%) and Cabernet Sauvignon. Aromas of flowers, herb, pencil lead and red fruit lead to light, flavorful, reserved and lengthy fruit flavors. The tannins are tightly wound and need some time to uncoil. Best after 2022.",90,35.0,Washington
70281,US,"Here's a powerfully fruity Napa red wine to drink tonight with roasts, cheeses, or just a nice burger. It's full-bodied, dry and rich in tannins, with black currant, anise, dark chocolate and smoky oak flavors. A blend of Bordeaux varieties and Syrah.",87,36.0,California
70282,Argentina,"Initial aromas of clove and cinnamon suggest a lot of barrel action, but give it a few minutes and the wine settles on ripe black fruit, dark spice notes and richness. It's big-boned but not overly tannic, and it exhibits Shiraz's bacon and espresso character in a good way.",89,12.0,Mendoza Province
70283,US,"Always pretty, always polished, St. Jean's '05 Cinq Cepages is a solid red wine that drinks well now and should develop with a few years in the cellar. It's dry and firm in tannins, with flavors of blackberries, cassis and new smoky oak, marked by a soft texture of finely ground tannins.",92,75.0,California
70284,Australia,"An honest and very ripe take on Australian Chardonnay, with opulent notes of fig, pineapple and guava underscored by crisp lemon and a faint spritz that refresh the palate. The short-to-medium finish turns a bit soft. Quite likable on the whole. Try with lobster.",85,18.0,Western Australia
70285,Slovenia,"Earthy with hints of roasted nuts and dried herb, this is a uniquely savory Sauvignon that would pair well with herb-accented fowl and fish. The palate is round and rich, but balanced with brisk lime acidity and a characteristic grassiness on the finish.",84,20.0,Slovenia
70286,Italy,"This is a gorgeous and linear wine that boasts beautiful layers of black currant, tar, asphalt, drying mineral, green spice, curry powder and licorice. Made from a blend of Cabernet Sauvignon, Cabernet Franc and Merlot, this wine has aged well over the years and promises additional longevity thanks to its bright acidity and the integrity of its fruit.",93,60.0,Northeastern Italy
70287,US,"Josh Jensen's appellation blend is arguably the best American white wine for the price. This vintage offers squeezed tangerine, fleur de sel, lily, apple blossom, apple fritters and a touch of tropicality on the nose. The palate is more steely in structure, with chalk and concrete minerality followed by grapefruit skin and lime flavors, revealing the slightest hint of balanced butter tones.",92,20.0,California
70288,US,"Here's a ripely fruity Chardonnay that pulls out all the stops to achieve opulence, and largely succeeds. Defines the modern style of winemaking, with extracted pineapple, orange and caramelized oak flavors, wrapped into a creamy, leesy texture that's brightened with zingy acidity. Drink now.",90,45.0,California
70289,US,"Given neutral oak, native yeast, passive carbonation and left unfined and unfiltered, this sublime wine, made by Pax Mahle and sourced from a windswept vineyard impacted by the Petaluma Gap, doesn't hold back in flavor or complexity. Gamy manure and white pepper mingle on the nose before opening the way to sultry, brooding waves of spicy, tangy orange and plum. This wine is pretty and powerful at the same time, while riding a low-wave of alcohol.",94,36.0,California
70290,US,"Juicy in red fruit, orange and rhubarb, this wine offers sizable body against a backbone of impressively balanced oak. Dry, firm tannins add to the strength and resonance of the palate, while subtle floral aromas lend intrigue to the bouquet.",92,75.0,California
70291,US,"This red wine, named for the chef at the winery restaurant, is fruity and high-toned, with lots of cherry and berry flavor. All neutral oak, soft tannins, ready to drink.",86,55.0,Washington
70292,US,"A light wine, in color, texture and flavor. It has simple blackberry and oak flavors, and is priced right.",83,9.0,California
70293,US,"Smells raw and minty, like mint jelly that's been mixed in with some raspberry jelly, and tastes sweet and artificially oaked. Overpriced for the quality.",82,19.0,California
70294,Italy,"Scents of white flower and orchard fruit lift from the glass. The bright, straightforward palate offers yellow apple and citrus alongside crisp acidity.",87,19.0,Northeastern Italy
70295,Israel,"Deep red-violet to the eye, this wine has a well-defined nose of blueberry pie and flint. There is a good mix of tart fruit and spice, with flavors of blueberry, cranberry, black pepper, anise and smoked meat cavorting amidst very soft tannins. The smooth finish is characterized by flavors of smoke and orange zest.",92,53.0,Galilee
70296,New Zealand,"This is made in a plump, cheerful style, combining simple, jammy cherry fruit with ample vanilla. It's a well-made wine, but one that comes across as somewhat lacking in dimension. For an entry-level Pinot Noir, perhaps that's all one can expect.",85,20.0,Central Otago
70297,Chile,"Aromas of grapefuit blend with green, vegetal notes of asparagus. The palate is pliant and easy, with mango, citrus and green bean flavors. Doesn't commit to being green and vegetal or blaring and citric; falls in between.",84,13.0,Leyda Valley
70298,US,This single-vineyard Chard with no oak has a light bouquet with nuances of white florals and red apple. The palate offers more heft and concentration with flavors of peach preserves and clementine supremes. Lower alcohol with a medium-length finish; rich and tasty without being overdone.,86,11.0,New York
70299,France,"A crisp, red-fruit flavored wine that has sufficient structure to give it shape and density. It is fruity with spice from the wood aging. Acidity at the end keeps it fresh and bright. Drink from 2017.",88,17.0,Bordeaux
70300,New Zealand,"Not overly concentrated or extracted, this is a plump, medium-bodied Pinot Noir that should have broad appeal for its cherry and cinnamon aromas and flavors and reasonable price. It's clean and refreshing on the finish, which is anchored by hints of mocha. Drink now.",87,14.0,Marlborough
70301,France,"This wine is very young, still with layers of wood. It is going to be a structured, dense and packed with a strong mineral texture. To contrast, generous red plum fruits and intense acidity are ready to convey a deep, rich character. Drink this impressive wine from 2019",96,,Burgundy
70302,US,"This is a strong, full-bodied rosé with ripe, jammy strawberry and raspberry flavors that finish off dry with fruity essence.",85,18.0,California
70303,Germany,"Buoyant floral perfume contrasts a slightly restrained palate that's more mineral than fruit. Off dry in style with delicate tones of honey and caramel, it finishes brisk and clean.",87,13.0,Rheinhessen
70304,Argentina,"This light and refreshing SB offers mild apple and citrus aromas, a snappy, citric palate and basic flavors of green apple and lime. As a whole, it's a cleansing but fairly standard wine.",84,12.0,Mendoza Province
70305,US,"This is made from the winery's estate vineyard, but from lots not included in the main blend, which costs twice as much. You'll find plenty of tannins in this darkly colored, impressively concentrated 100% Cabernet. It's fresh, soft and juicy in blackberry and cherry jam flavors, with a rich earthiness. Just delightful for drinking over the next four years, and a great value.",93,30.0,California
70306,Germany,"Brambly, herbaceous notes lend a dark, savory tone to preserved apple and peach flavors in this spätlese. Dusty minerals add some complexity to the mid-palate.",84,12.0,Mosel
70307,Croatia,"High-toned, red cherry fruit aromas on this bold, full-bodied Croatian Pinot transition nicely to a deeply concentrated black fruit palate sprinkled with cocoa and vanilla notes. The texture is lush overall, but grape tannins feel harsh and grippy on the finish.",84,13.0,Podunavlje
70308,France,"It's full of bright red fruits, a lively mineral texture and a pure line of acidity. Bone dry, it is as fresh and crisp as possible.",89,25.0,Provence
70309,US,"Dilute and slightly bitter, this does not reflect the warm near-perfect 2014 vintage. Thin generic red fruit comes and goes quickly, with earthy, stemmy tannins left to finish.",82,25.0,Oregon
70310,Italy,"This is a pleasant red wine from Piedmont in northern Italy made with Nebbiolo and Vespolina grapes for a clean delivery of berry, spice and cola aromas. The wine is tonic and fresh in the mouth with clean acidity and playful bite of exotic spice on the close.",88,40.0,Piedmont
70311,Chile,"This is cool-coast Chilean SB from front to back. Vegetal-leaning aromas of asparagus, cactus and lime are what the Paredones microzone has become known for. This tastes slightly pickled and intense, with coastal green-fruit notes leading the finish. High acidity ensure that this is super racy.",90,21.0,Colchagua Valley
70312,Argentina,"Spicy, medicinal cherry, tomato and herb aromas lead to a palate with rubbery tannins and moderate astringency. A fresh and tasty mix of spicy, rooty berry flavors ends with brushy, herbal, chocolaty notes on the finish.",88,30.0,Other
70313,US,"Aromas of mineral, flowers and freshly cut green apple are followed by a just off-dry, lightly spritzy palate full of stone-fruit flavors.",88,13.0,Washington
70314,France,"Notes of grass, lime leaf and garrigue herbs lead the bouquet of this attractive wine, supported by fruity tones of white melon, green plum and citrus peel. The medium-weight mouthfeel is countered by ample acidity and pithy flavors that finish slightly astringent. Drink now.",86,12.0,Languedoc-Roussillon
70315,France,"This is a chateau that is getting better and better. This 2009 is packed with sweet fruit, impressive tannins and a complex dark structure. It is fruity, yet powerful, for good aging.",92,58.0,Bordeaux
70316,US,"As the name makes clear, this wine is made from a head-pruned, older block of very unlikely Syrah at the estate property, as seductive as rare. Plum, black cherry, leather and black pepper jump from the glass, slowly and with purpose, around a core of burly tannin and intensely floral aromatics. This is a great wine.",93,45.0,California
70317,France,"This is light and crisp, with its acidity dominant. It's packed with lime and grapefruit flavors that lend a taut, nervy texture. Not for aging, this is refreshing now.",85,,Burgundy
70318,Chile,"A stacked nose includes aromas of tomato, herbs, cocoa, molasses and berry fruits. The saturated palate announces that this is a big one, while spicy flavors of plum and berry fruits are slightly herbal on a finish with excellent feel and flow. Drink this blend of Cabernet Franc, Cabernet Sauvignon and Carmenère through 2021.",92,40.0,Maipo Valley
70319,US,"The best thing about this wine is the acidity. It's so bright and mouthwatering, it provides a perfect balance to jammy citrus, tropical fruit and peach flavors. Honeyed on the palate, it's a good partner for Cantonese and Vietnamese fare.",87,25.0,California
70320,US,"Kandorian makes a stainless-steel version of Sauvignon Blanc, and also this heavily-oaked style, which is about as far in the other direction as possible. It's deep gold, scented with strong whiskey-barrel aromas, and tasting of nut oil and superripe apples, plus plenty of oak.",87,30.0,Oregon
70321,Australia,"Of the three Cherubino 2010 Cabernets, I slightly preferred this one (the blended version), but just by a hair. The nose boasts seductive aromas of cedar, smoke, brown sugar and maple syrup, backed up on the palate by a convergence of chocolaty and meaty flavors that end in a softly dusty finale. Full bodied and supple, it's drinkable now, but should drink well through at least 2020.",94,54.0,Western Australia
70322,US,"From the winery's Pritchard Hill estate, where it may be a little too warm for Chardonnay. This is a good wine, if a little soft, with herb, citrus, tropical fruit and oak flavors. Ready to drink now.",89,35.0,California
70323,US,"Quite yellow in the glass, this twist-top bottling shows a slight hint of reduction, with aromas of beeswax, lemon peel and yellow grapefruit pith. There's a good sizzle of acidity to the palate and a steely texture, but it's a tad ripe with lemon candy and spun-sugar flavors.",87,32.0,California
70324,US,"Rich and appealing, this feels classy, with smooth tannins framing cherry and licorice flavors.",86,15.0,California
70325,Chile,"Tomato, herb, rubber and olive aromas are gritty. This Syrah fits right into the house style for this grape variety; the palate is pointed, acidic and scouring, while flavors of lemon rind, currant, graphite, herbs and pepper finish zesty, with herbal leftovers and lots of oak.",88,41.0,Casablanca Valley
70326,US,"The deeply extracted nose offers plum liqueur, cola and cedar. It proves rich and juicy once sipped as well, with prune, berry syrup, licorice and mocha combining for a very big Pinot Noir.",87,38.0,California
70327,US,"Another of the producer's mountain reds, this features rough-hewn tannin that grips the palate with tenacity and power, yielding to show juicy acidity and fully realized cedar, dusty cranberry and cassis flavors.",92,120.0,California
70328,US,"The aromas are a bit subdued for the variety, with notes of apricot, jasmine and flowers. The palate drinks sweet, with abundant stone-fruit flavors that provide a lot of easy-drinking appeal.",87,14.0,Idaho
70329,US,"Lovely aromatics push scents of espresso, cassis, truffle and baker's chocolate right up front. The wine is polished, fine-boned and balanced, with taut cranberry and raspberry fruit. It brings in subtle accents of chalk, earth, rock and lead pencil, building to a firm, beautifully structured finish.",92,50.0,Washington
70330,US,"Cherry, cinnamon and vanilla play on the light-bodied, softly layered palate of this estate wine that develops flavor and aroma over time in the glass. Deeper, darker waves of boysenberry enter the picture toward the finish.",87,60.0,California
70331,US,"It's rich in blackberry jam, with heady notes of cassis liqueur and sweet oak. At this price, it's a great everyday wine.",85,13.0,California
70332,US,"Baking-spice notes of mace and nutmeg meet with sage, incense, oak and sandalwood components across dark red fruit on the nose of this clonal study. It's delicate in mouthfeel, but heavily spiced with oregano and thyme atop cranberry, beet and raspberry fruits that surround graphite.",93,46.0,California
70333,US,"With a creamy mouthfeel and ripe flavors of tangerines, tropical fruits, honey and sweet oak, this is a flashy effort. It will appeal to fans of the variety, and rightfully so, delivering a dry complexity that lifts it way above the average.",92,30.0,California
70334,Australia,"Medium to full bodied, with nicely supple tannins, Wirra Wirra's Church Block is an attractive wine for near-term consumption. Flavors in this blend of 48% Cabernet, 37% Shiraz and 15% Merlot range from broiled tomato to tart berry, then pick up some dried fruit character with air, finishing with an unusually tart edge.",87,20.0,South Australia
70335,France,"From this rich vintage comes this delicious, open wine. Flavors of tropical fruit and peach create an opulent and generous feel, with notes from having aged in wood offering complexity. It's concentrated and ageworthy, worth keeping for 4–5 years and more.",93,70.0,Burgundy
70336,US,"This wine opens with aromas of earthy funk, steak tartare, potpourri, pepper and earth, showing outrageously minerality. The flavors are dense and textured, leaning hard into the savory with abundant flower and fire pit notes that linger effortlessly. It's a very cerebral wine but with no shortage of hedonism.",95,120.0,Washington
70337,US,"A terrific Cabernet made from a blend of various Paso Robles vineyards. Just delicious, a young, softly appealing wine brimming with blackberry, cherry, currant, mocha and cedar flavors. Beautiful now, especially with a grilled steak or lamb chop.",90,30.0,California
70338,US,"This fragrant wine from an excellent vintage offers terrific value. Silky and potent, it features mixed flavors of berries, cherries, cola and mocha, with a dash of white pepper.",90,21.0,Oregon
70339,US,"Perhaps the lightest Pinot in the producer's lineup, and the most readily accessible, this is fresh and fruity. Highlighted in strawberry and cherry, it retains a tension of black tea and earth. Silky on the palate, it finishes as lightly as it started.",90,39.0,California
70340,US,"Elusive aromas mask an easygoing, straightforward white from the heart of the Russian River Valley. Characterized by matchstick and melon, it offers layering the back palate with additional flavors of apple and pear.",85,20.0,California
70341,US,"This rosé is quite ripe tasting, like a white-sugared tropical-fruit-juice blend, with alcohol. On the plus side is clean acidity.",82,20.0,California
70342,Italy,"This opens with perfumed aromas of blue flower, cherry and wild berry. Soft and simple, it has a pretty floral finish of red rose and violet.",85,17.0,Central Italy
70343,Italy,"This blend of 90% Sangiovese, 5% Cabernet Sauvignon and 5% Merlot opens with leafy, almost weedy aromas that burn off to reveal black fruit and green pepper. On the palate, a core of black cherry mingles with espresso and coffee notes. Round with velvety tannins, this is already accessible so enjoy soon.",87,35.0,Tuscany
70344,France,"With a fine balance between some rigorous tannins and a more generous black-fruit character, this is a wine both to appreciate now and to age. The wine is perfumed, with spice from the wood aging and mint and thyme aromas. This serious wine is just ready to drink, but that would be a shame, so wait until 2018.",92,105.0,Burgundy
70345,US,"Off-dry and minty, with a strong streak of wintergreen, this simple, fruity Riesling offers fruit flavors of green apple and a bit of waxy lemon.",85,15.0,Washington
70346,US,"There's a reduced, concentrated effect to this wine, a bold expression of the variety rich in tobacco and black tea, the fruit bittersweet and elusive. Tightly wound, it benefits from air and time in the glass, and will please a Cabernet lover's palate most of all.",87,50.0,California
70347,US,"Silky, light-bodied and dry, with flavors of cherries, cola and herbs. It's a simple wine that gets the Pinot concept across in a direct way.",84,14.0,California
70348,New Zealand,"Green notes lead the parade here: Grass, peas and tomato leaf march ahead of the lemon citrus notes, with an intriguing struck-match character taking up the rear. On the palate, the acidity is prominent but in check, and the slightly chalky texture is appealing. When it comes to flavor, however, it loses much of what the nose offers, finishing a little flat and bitter.",88,20.0,Marlborough
70349,Italy,"This inky blend of Pallagrello Nero and Casavecchia (two of Italy's oldest grape varieties) opens with opulent aromas of chocolate, exotic spice, dark fruit, cola and cinnamon. It is smooth and rich on the palate but the wine also imparts a high dose of sweetness and succulence that would work well next to rare beef.",93,80.0,Southern Italy
70350,US,"Made in the style of Monticello's 2008s, a ripe, softly delicious wine. It packs lots of berry, cherry, currant and chocolate fruit, with a savory earthiness suggesting green olives. Flashy enough to drink now, and could gain bottle interest over the next six years, if not longer.",90,65.0,California
70351,US,"Citrus aromas and ripe melon flavors give a clean, fruity personality to this medium-bodied wine. Honeydew, mild peach and lemon nuances ride a crisp texture.",88,18.0,California
70352,US,"This vintage shows cut grass, ripe apple, pear, wet cement and nectarine sorbet aromas in a wine that's almost as clear as water. The palate is textural and full of zip, with rainy day-like crispness and green fruit flavors.",90,11.0,California
70353,US,"White flowers, nectarine, red apple and a steely minerality greet the nose on this entry-level wine from Rajat Parr. A bright and racy acidity frames the energetic palate that shows delicate flavors of yellow apples, lemon juice and honeysuckle.",88,33.0,California
70354,US,"Tastes soft and almost sweet, with melted raspberry and cherry-pie-filling flavors. It's rich and oaky, but the palate lacks some grip, some structure, something to hang on to.",85,65.0,California
70355,France,"Certified French organic with this vintage, this 100% Merlot is ripe, full-bodied and already showing its potential richness. Terroir-driven black fruits and generous tannins give a warm character to the wine that is then backed by black fruits and final acidity. This is a generous wine from the Verdier family, ready to age. Drink from 2018.",89,18.0,Bordeaux
70356,France,"This is a ripe wine, its herbaceous character tempered by green plum and pineapple flavors. It's full in the mouth, with a hint of steeliness to give texture. Great to drink this summer.",85,12.0,Southwest France
70357,US,"From a new producer, this Chiles Valley-grown white crackles in waxy apple and lemon-zest aromas. It was aged in mostly stainless steel, with a small addition of neutral oak. Peach fuzz dominates atop the creamy texture, providing brightness in an otherwise full-bodied, though balanced, wine.",90,28.0,California
70358,US,"Shannon Ridge is quietly becoming the king of Lake County, offering wines of both quality and value and this is no exception. This blend is made of Zinfandel, Syrah, Petite Sirah, Cabernet Sauvignon and Mourvèdre. The kitchen-sink approach doesn't muddle the wine in any way; it remains a smooth, fruity, ripe quaff, with a kick of vanilla on the finish.",87,19.0,California
70359,Germany,"Zesty lime and lemon aromas are touched with wet slate on this dry, refreshingly lean Riesling. It's demure in fruit profile, but vibrant with acidity and a bristling mineral tone.",87,30.0,Mosel
70360,US,"Apple blossom intrigues on the nose of this light-bodied, low-oaked white. It's both steely and revealing, showing succulent mango, peach and pear. The acidity is lively and balanced.",90,20.0,California
70361,US,"This 100% varietal wine from both Alexander Valley and Sonoma Valley sites opens in aromas of raspberry, blackberry and vanilla, tangy and stemmy in the background, with a plume of dusty earth.",88,28.0,California
70362,US,"Although this is comprised of more than 50% Syrah, this five grape Rhône-style blend seems more influenced by the Grenache. Plenty of mixed berry flavors surface quickly, proving to be bright and spicy, before running into some drying tannins that are marked with a green edge.",87,25.0,Washington
70363,Spain,"Cheesy aromas and a whiff of wet cement are more pronounced than basic plum scents. This tastes of candied fruits and chocolate prior to a simple sweet, sugary finish.",83,11.0,Northern Spain
70364,US,"Shows the flowery, honeyed notes of Riesling, with pleasant citrus, apple and peach flavors. It's a little soft, but will drink well with ham, sausages or just about anything with bacon.",83,10.0,California
70365,US,"This barrel-forward (60% new French oak), 100% varietal wine offers notes of vanilla, pencil lead and wood spices along with cherry and herb accents. The smooth flavors are etched by tart acids, with grainy, dry tannins rounding it out.",89,50.0,Washington
70366,US,"Tasted in August, crisp acidity gave this Chardonnay a slight effervescence that may disappear by the time you taste it. The sparkliness, however, actually is a welcome balance to rich, ripe pineapple, peach, vanilla and buttered toast flavors.",85,25.0,California
70367,US,"Even if you like some earthy, mushroomy notes in your Syrah, this one is unripe to the point of vegetal. It's also too soft for balance. Despite some decent blackberry and cola flavors, it's a real disappointment.",82,35.0,California
70368,US,"This is a blend of Rutz's single-vineyard Pinots. Displays the fleshy, berry and tomato flavors of Dutton Ranch and Martinelli, and is very similar to both. Makes the case for blending. It doesn't hit the heights, but is a refined wine, and a versatile one. —S.H.",87,25.0,California
70369,Germany,"There's so much body and ripeness in this bold, dry-style Riesling, it's admittedly blousy, but irresistibly so. Voluptuous and alcoholic on the palate, it shows intensely concentrated peach and cantaloupe flavors, as well as a sensual, almost oily, mineral richness. It may not age for decades but offers plenty of hedonistic enjoyment through 2021.",93,38.0,Rheingau
70370,New Zealand,"The style at Martinborough Vineyards has always been geared toward aging, and this 2011 is still remarkably fresh. Floral and cherry notes lead the way, backed by tart acids and firm tannins. Worth stashing away until 2018.",90,90.0,Martinborough
70371,Argentina,"Hints of wisteria and lemon blossom give this dilute Chardonnay a respectable bouquet, while the palate is mild and tastes like bites of lemon, apple and orange. There's not much weight or stuffing to it, but it's generally clean and inoffensive.",83,13.0,Mendoza Province
70372,US,"This Bordeaux-style red blend is pleasantly fruity, with blackberry and red cherry components buoyed by supporting acidity. A slight suggestion of tar and earth adds a bit of gravitas to what is otherwise a fruit-driven, simple quaffer.",87,25.0,Washington
70373,US,"A full-bodied yet crisp Chardonnay, balanced with just a tiny hint of lingering ripeness. Fine for mid-week meals.",86,18.0,California
70374,France,"Close to Epernay and on the cusp of the Chardonnay-dominated Côte des Blancs, this producer has Grand Cru holdings in the village of Chouilly. Those vines have produced a wine that balances mineral-laced fruit with a soft aftertaste. Young and with apple flavors, it's great now but will continue to develop in the cellar. Drink from 2018.",90,49.0,Champagne
70375,France,"Raspberries with hints of cranberry dominate this juicy but structured wine. This is a wine that shows a very elegant style, certainly not forceful, but deliciously direct.",91,59.0,Burgundy
70376,US,"Another in the new N&N; line, the Sullenger features red and black fruit, herbs, some earth, and an appealing whiff of sautéed pancetta or bacon. Commendable richness in support of black-plum flavor and coffee notes. Its poundcake-like density urges cellaring.",92,65.0,California
70377,Chile,"A jammy, grapey bouquet offers blueberry and spice aromas but not much complexity or nuance. The palate is lively, with acidic cut and leathery, herbal flavors of raspberry, plum and pepper. This is bouncy feeling and tastes earthy and chocolaty on the finish. Drink now through 2015.",89,22.0,Cachapoal Valley
70378,US,"Rich and full bodied, this abounds with pretty flower, sweet peach and pear aromas mingled with a toasted oak. It's decidedly oaky on the palate, with an abundance of smoke, vanilla and coconut notes. Generous in body, this has nicely extracted apple and lemon flavors. Drink now.",85,27.0,Virginia
70379,US,"A fine Cabernet that defines Alexander Valley's benchlands. It's entirely dry, a subtle wine whose herb-tinged blackberries, cherries and cedar turn increasingly complex in the glass. Shows a lightness and airy feeling that differentiates it from the heavier cult Napa style. Already throwing some sediment, so you might want to decant it before serving.",93,58.0,California
70380,US,"Pungent notes of cocoa, herb, medicine cabinet, vanilla and cherry liqueur mark this wine's nose. The palate is full bodied with firm, dry tannins and dried out fruit flavors.",86,13.0,Washington
70381,US,"It's rare to see a varietal bottle of Chardonnay from this appellation. This one comes from Birch Creek Vineyard and has alluring aromas of lees, almond, peach and straw. The creamy stone-fruit flavors have a sense of richness but are also quite deft, with a finish that lingers.",91,48.0,Washington

70385,France,"Ripe black fruits combine with bitter chocolate and toast from the wood to give a very ripe wine. It is structured at this stage but is likely to ripen and round out over the next 3–4 years to give a rich, smooth, Merlot style.",88,34.0,Bordeaux
70386,US,"As can happen with young wines like just-released rosé, a slight bit of effervescence is visible. The interesting smell of fermentation gives rise to strawberry and pink bubblegum scents. The gum persists on the palate, but in a pleasant, not overwhelming or sweet way, as does red licorice and watermelon.",90,16.0,California
70387,US,"Tastes unusual soft and melted for a Santa Lucia Highlands Syrah, but the blackberry, licorice, cola and sweet oak flavors sure are delicious. The absence of structure makes the wine finish  quick, and will not allow it to age, so drink up.",86,34.0,California
70388,New Zealand,"Better known for its Pinot Noir, Ata Rangi has turned in a fine performance with its 2007 Sauvignon Blanc. It's grassy, but balanced by ripe fig and stone fruit characters that weave an intricately detailed medium-weight palate. Long on the finish. Drink now–2009.",91,27.0,Martinborough
70389,US,"Two-thirds Cabernet Sauvignon with the balance Petit Verdot, Merlot, Malbec and Carménère, this brooding wine brings aromas of moist soil, herb, black tea, eucalyptus, fig and spice.

70390,US,"Soft and fruity, this Cabernet has fruit-forward flavors of blackberry, cherry pie and smoky oak. It's a tasty wine whose firm tannins suggest decanting for a few hours before service. Drink over the next few years.",87,50.0,California
70391,US,"Not the best Monte Bello to emerge in recent years. There's a sharpness of acidity that cuts the palate, and it accentuates the fresh fruit, giving it a jammy zing. More troubling is an overripe raisiny flavor. This bottling is, of course, one of the most ageable in California, but the inherent imbalance seems to mitigate against long time in the cellar.",88,145.0,California
70392,Italy,"Aromas of leather, tobacco leaf, underbrush, and prune marinated in spirits take center stage on this dense wine. The palate delivers mature plum, blueberry extract, toast, black pepper and mocha alongside bracing tannins.",89,80.0,Veneto

70394,France,"Packed with tannins, this dark-hued wine is concentrated, demanding aging. It has spice and layers of wood as well as black plums and acidity. It is a powerful wine, full of dark chocolate as well as fruit and tannins. Drink from 2023.",93,,Burgundy
70395,US,"This top tier effort captures all the most distinctive characteristics of good Oregon Pinot Noir. Black cherry fruit, a liberal dash of cola, a touch of sassafras and a dusting of baking spice combine in a burst of flavor. Delicious already, it will drink well for another half decade or longer.",92,65.0,Oregon
70396,US,"A solid, everyday Pinot that shows flavors of cherries, root beer, oranges, anise, mint and peppery spices. Feels silky and crisp in the mouth. It's a little rough, but will support a wide assortment of foods.",85,25.0,California
70397,US,"The aromas are initially more fruit forward than often seen from this area, with notes of plum followed by ash, black pepper, Stargazer lilies, charcuterie and iron. The flavors are palate coating and dense in feel, lingering on the finish. It needs some time in the cellar to truly show its stuff. Best after 2022.",93,97.0,Oregon
70398,US,"Delicious is the word that comes to mind drinking this Pinot Noir. It's young and vibrant in acidity, with waves of raspberries, persimmons, honey, cinnamon, cloves and smoky sandalwood. Good over the next five years.",90,29.0,California
70399,US,"This is Baileyana's top Chardonnay, and the '06 defines what makes Edna Valley such a special place to grow it.

70400,US,"Crafted from a mix of 48% Syrah, 45% Grenache and 7% Mourvèdre, this aromatic rosé is spicy and bursting with star fruit, citrus, apple, pear, apricot and more. It's a lively full-bodied wine with a smooth finish.",89,16.0,Oregon
70401,France,"Mitans is one of the lesser-known premier crus in Volnay, and it has created a wine that shows the voluptuousness of Volnay. It has a smoky character, and it's laced with acidity and bright red fruit. It will benefit from 3–4 years of aging.",91,,Burgundy
70402,US,"Barrel fermented in new and used French oak and aged sur lie for seven months, this appealing wine brings aromas of pear, spice, fig and papaya. The Sémillon blended in (16%) adds to the palate's richness and weight, with the pleasingly long finish contributing to the enjoyment.",90,20.0,Washington

70407,US,"This has a very deep, dark color that goes almost to the rim. It smells like blackberries and black pepper, tastes exotic and almost full-bodied but stays quite dry.

70409,US,"This hedonistically powerful mix of 80% Cabernet Sauvignon, 16% Merlot and 4% Petit Verdot traffics in blackberry and black cherry jam over a layer of soft tannins. Coffee, toffee and subtle Asian and cinnamon spice keep the proceedings lively, for this is a seriously ripe and playful wine. Cellar through 2020.",93,200.0,California
70410,France,"Upfront fruit aromas present the bouquet much like a fruit salad, with forward scents of guava, mango, banana and citrus supremes.

70411,US,"This resplendent white offers a wealth of wet stone minerality and crisp, lemony acidity, with just a subtle hint of oak. From old vines, it boasts tangerine and anise flavors on the palate, with tropical notes of guava and mango and a jolt of nuttiness.",93,50.0,California

70418,Chile,"Tarry dark-fruit aromas are piercing and slightly herbal. This is a staunch, rock-solid Cab with tannic bite and structural grip.

Freshness combined with ripeness and body weight conveys the wine's depth and overall quality.",89,15.0,Cachapoal Valley
70419,Chile,"Graphite, deep black fruit, earth and cola aromas make for a full-force, inviting entry.

High quality for $20 Cabernet.",90,20.0,Maipo Valley
70420,US,"This is the inaugural release of this wine, which is composed of fruit from Pepper Bridge and Seven Hills vineyards. It's aromatically generous, with appealing notes of sage, dried herb, cassis, dark chocolate, spice, pencil lead and dark fruit.

70423,US,"Offered in a half-bottle size, this estate Cab-based wine also contains 6% Merlot and 6% Petit Verdot. The blend is crisp, dry and tannic in cranberry, barely ripe cherry and dried currant, swerving savory into dried herb and clove.",89,65.0,California
70424,US,"Dry and papery, this not-quite-settled wine shows threads of fruit (green apple, pineapple), toasted cracker (odd in a Riesling) and plenty of sharp acidity. Time may be the missing ingredient here, but it's difficult to assess at the moment.",86,18.0,Oregon
70425,US,"Grenache makes up 70% of this wine with the rest equal parts Mourvèdre and Syrah. The aromas of raspberry and spice are brooding while the raspberry, cranberry and floral flavors are tart and lithe, with a finish that lingers.",88,30.0,Washington

70428,US,"From the winery's estate plantings above Seven Hills Vineyard in the new SeVein project, this wine is still closed aromatically, needing time or air to coax out its vanilla, toast, herb and dark cherry notes.

70429,US,"Cottonwood Canyon specializes in Pinot Noir and Chardonnay, but they also have three acres of Syrah in their Santa Maria vineyard. The result in this bottling offers aromas blending red fruit with minty herbs, like a cherry cough drop. The wine is fairly lean on the mouth, representative of a cooler-climate expression of the grape, with oregano, sour cherry, cranberry and chalky minerality. The finish is reminiscent of crème brûlée.",91,68.0,California
70430,US,"This is a tremendous wine that's packed with flavor and dramatically structured. It's made in the modern cult style of exceptionally rich and ripe with sweet, toasty oak, and delicious blackberries, black currants, dark chocolate and anise. The tannins are strong, but refined.

70431,US,"This is always one of Janzen's best bottlings, courtesy of one of the jewels in the Beckstoffer crown of vineyards.

70432,US,"This lush, toasty, vividly fruity wine can't miss with a wide variety of seafood, pasta and poultry dishes. There's plenty of acid under full-bodied apple and melon and peach fruit.

Made from 100% Cabernet, it shows the concentrated intensity of mountain fruit, with a molten core of blackberry essence, cassis liqueur, cola and spice flavors, liberally oaked and wrapped into gorgeously thick but fine tannins.

70439,US,"Green pear, candied lemon rinds, sharp lime pith and a bit of struck-match smoke arise on the nose of this appellation blend from the veteran winemaker, one of the few working inside the city limits of San Luis Obispo.

70440,US,"This is a skin-contact wine, fermented on skins for a week, that displays the technique in its dark golden color. From there, it's ripe in a sweetness of baked pear, honey and dried apricot, while lean on the palate despite the fleshy nature of the fruit.",86,35.0,California
70441,US,"A creamy texture and apple pie flavors make this so rich it's almost a dessert. It is not actually sweet but has a full body and lush viscosity, presumably from barrel fermentation. It shows the shaping influence that barrels can have on heft and mouthfeel without adding heavy oak flavors per se. Delicious!",91,20.0,California
70442,US,"This good, basic wine offers herb and cherry aromas, mostly crisp fruit flavors and a firm, tannic texture.",85,12.0,California

70447,US,"As the producer's first 100% Syrah, this impressive wine shows the vibrancy of cool-climate influence in distinct notes of saddle leather and white pepper on the nose. Integrated in oak and smooth on the palate, it takes time to come around in floral raspberry.",91,49.0,California
70448,US,"Soft and sweet in fruity extract and glycerols, and very high in alcohol, this Syrah is almost a dessert wine. There's no denying the flavors of blackberries, currants, sweet oak and chocolate are impressive, yet the wine needs greater dryness and structure.",86,60.0,California
70449,US,"The winery's first release off its estate vineyard in The Rocks offers expressive, captivating aromas of peat, dried flowers, fire pit, herbs, grilled asparagus, funk and green olive. The flavors are sweet, sumptuous and rich, showing depth and detail. It's a knockout.",95,60.0,Washington
70450,US,"Consistent with the Lake Chelan winery's lineup of red wines, this young Syrah brings a lot of generous, berry-flavored primary fruits, softened tannins and a deep purple color.

70454,US,"A single-clone, single-vineyard, estate wine. Released young, it is oaky, liquorous and sharply volatile. Plenty of plum and sweet berry fruit flavors suggest a wine with the power to age, but at the moment it has not come together, and has a vinegary bite to the finish.",87,50.0,Washington

70458,US,"This is the best Jewel Block bottling ever from Dutton. The vineyard is in the heart of Green Valley, one of the coolest parts of Russian River, and the magnificent vintage has yielded a fantastically ripe wine, balanced with rich, crisp acidity.

Give it until mid-2008, and it will drink well through 2013, at least.",94,47.0,California

70462,Israel,"Red-violet in the glass, this wine has a nose of black cherry, cocoa and freshly ground coffee.

Everything seems to build toward the finish, which is long and luxurious.",92,35.0,California
70467,US,"Cabernet Sauvignon and Cabernet Franc each make up 50% of this blend. The aromas are forward, with notes of matchstick, smoke, herb, char and game. The flavors are lighter in style, with game and herb influences throughout that distract.",86,50.0,Washington
70468,US,"There's a lemony leanness to this exquisite wine, from one of the most esteemed vineyards in its region, a site the producer has worked with for more than 20 years.

70480,US,"Having seen 20 months in French oak, the aromas of this wine are dominated by cola and rooibos tones.

70495,US,"A Bordeaux blend from Newton's mountain estate, this lovely wine starts out with a fat, fleshy appeal. It offers elaborate waves of sweetly smoked oak that conjoin nicely with cherry preserves, red licorice and dark chocolate.

70558,France,"Grown on southwest-facing slopes, this is a ripe, full wine with a natural warmth as well as a mineral texture. It is still tight and needs to age with its gooseberry and herbal edge as well as more flinty, smoky background. Drink from 2017.",91,30.0,Loire Valley
70559,France,"While it is dry, this wine is so rich that it has a honeyed, sweet character. It is very full, ripe, full of grapefruit, white stone fruits and tight Meyer lemon. It is still in its youthful fruity phase and needs to age. Drink from 2018.",93,,Alsace
70560,US,"This darkly-colored wine is a little on the heavy, fruity side for a rosé. But it's fantastically delicious, offering waves of berries, cola and spices. The acidity is refreshingly high. You can drink this instead of a red wine with lighter meats, such as lamb or pork.",90,25.0,California

70606,US,"As delicious and opulent as they come, yet it's somewhat formulaic. It's all about oak, insanely ripe black currant and dark chocolate fruit, ultrasmooth tannins and heat from alcohol.",90,85.0,California
70607,US,"Lush body and ripe, concentrated plum and currant flavors contrast an electric zip of acidity that brightens this wine. A blend of traditional Bordeaux grapes, it's elegantly composed, marked by hints of cedar and tobacco and a lingering fringe of fine-grained tannins.",89,30.0,New York
70608,Chile,"Although this Syrah-led blend is earthy, roasted and slightly rustic-smelling with dried berry aromas, it is lively in the mouth, with good acidity. Flavors of cherry, cassis and plum finish round and healthy, with weight and concentration but also lift. Drink through 2020.",90,35.0,Colchagua Valley
70609,France,"This wine is crisp and fruity. It has attractive acidity, a nice touch of spice and a backbone of minerality. The juiciness leaves a bright, crisp aftertaste.",86,35.0,Burgundy
70610,US,"The aromas of earth, char and dark berries are alluring. The flavors are rich but never lose their deftness.",90,30.0,Idaho
70611,France,"Brambles and undergrowth aromas give this wine a curious character reflected in the wild strawberry flavors that are not linked to the tannins. This seven-acre Thienpont family property is run by Jan, who has several wine projects, and Florian, who came to wine as a chef.",81,,Bordeaux
70612,US,"Light in color and spicy cherry fruit, it offers layers of oak and earth that compete for attention. The wine is a blend of three clones, including Pommard, which reveals itself in the wine's forested and floral character. Concentrated and relatively lush, it should stand the test of time and air; try from 2017–2019.",89,48.0,California
70613,US,"This big-production Pinot pierces through with smoke, char and stiff, earthy tannins. It's a chewy, rough wine, more herbal than fruity. It's got enough punch and power to hook up with grilled burgers or flank steak.",87,27.0,Oregon
70614,US,"Tastes a bit on the sweet, sugary side, but with the crisp acidity, it's balanced and elegant. The cherry, raspberry, lemongrass, vanilla, peppery spice and smoky wood flavors will work well against Thai or Vietnamese fare.",86,27.0,California
70615,US,"This wine impresses from first sip. The addition of 20% Viognier adds violet and lilac hints to the nose. Meat and lavender notes highlight its dense midpalate, packed with flavor and gravelly texture, blanketed with tannin and seasoned with white pepper and clove.",94,30.0,California
70616,US,"Slightly herbal aromas and generous, almost chocolaty fruit flavors make for a mouth-filling wine. It is full bodied, moderately tannic, and nicely dry despite the bold fruit character.",87,25.0,California
70617,US,"The Wallula vineyard, set high atop a bluff overlooking the Columbia river, gives grapes that bring dark, roasted flavors to the large-scale wine. The fruit tastes as if it has been pushed, perhaps a bit too far, and the impression it leaves tilts toward the raisiny side. It's a wine that could go in a positive direction with cellar time, but it is impossible to tell right now, as it cuts off quickly once in the mouth.",86,22.0,Washington
70618,France,"Situated between the two mountain ranges of Saint-Baume and Sainte-Victoire, this estate is dry and relatively cool in the summer. That produces this fresh, lightly pink-colored wine that has a smooth caramel flavor and rich strawberry fruits. The aftertaste is soft and ripe.",87,12.0,Provence
70619,US,"A testament to coolness—cool place, cool year—this Marin County Pinot is earthy, round and tight, suggesting it could use a little more time to develop. Cranberry and spice rule the roost and the wine's lightness of being would pair well with fresh-caught salmon not looking to be overwhelmed.",88,58.0,California
70620,New Zealand,"A solid value in the world of Pinot Noir, this is pleasantly complex on the nose, offering up hints of cola, root beer and green herbs layered over dark fruit aromas. On the palate, it's reasonably full bodied and supple, delivering savory, earthy notes without being inaccessible. Mocha and silk soften the finish.",91,30.0,Central Otago
70621,US,"Just a bit of Cabernet Franc and Cabernet Sauvignon is added to the blend, most of which comes from the Ciel du Cheval, Tapteil and Weinbau vineyards. In this cooler vintage, an herbal character emerges, lending firm tannins and structure to the tight black cherry and cassis core.",89,28.0,Washington
70622,US,"This is an interesting bottle from sourced fruit (rather than estate-grown). Ripe blackberry and black cherry fruit is matched to ripe tannins; the wine is dark, almost sultry, and the flavors flow seamlessly across the palate. There is a spicy lift and a hint of pickle barrel (American oak?) that concludes the presentation.",88,55.0,Oregon
70623,Chile,"The bouquet kicks up hints of graham cracker, iodine and earth. The mouth is fat and broad, with a goodly amount of typical plum and cherry flavors.

70626,France,"The wine is firm and structured, showing more structure than fruit. It is solid, tight and with vanilla and blackberry fruits that are still behind the tannins. Probably this wine will remain firm, although the tannins should soften. Drink from 2018.",88,25.0,Bordeaux
70627,US,"All coming from Block 1, this wine was fermented 65% whole cluster and aged for 20 months in neutral barrels. Pretty aromas of spice, flower, herb, cherry and earth give way to a full fruit-forward palate that shows a dazzling sense of purity and richness while also maintaining its restraint. It's a bit of a stylistic departure for the winery in terms of its richness but it still delivers big time.",92,30.0,Washington
70628,Argentina,"Briny notes of oyster shell blend with spicy barrel notes and core apple aromas on the bouquet of this crisp, pure, minerally Chardonnay. Flavors of apple, quince, orange marmalade and minerals finish sturdy and secure.",89,20.0,Mendoza Province

70630,US,"Negociant Hughes continues to produce compelling wines at everyday prices. This Syrah, from one of Napa Valley's best mountain regions, is dry and thick in refined tannins.

70631,South Africa,"This easygoing white starts with a fresh nose of grapefruit, fig and flowers and leads into zesty but complex flavors of tropical fruit and citrus. Approachable and balanced, the wine will pair well with seafood and chicken dishes.",88,13.0,Robertson
70632,France,"The spicy wood aroma that shows strongly on the nose of this wine is confirmed on the palate, as it seems to have spent too much time in barrels. The fruit has been neglected and is dry. It will open up with time, although the dryness will probably remain.",85,28.0,Bordeaux
70633,US,"Pleasantly dank aromas of smoldering pine needles, leather and gamy meats hit the nose on this 2% Viognier coferment. Flavors are reminiscent of roasted wild boar, with dark chocolate, creosote and beef crust, presented against grippy tannins.",92,42.0,California

70635,France,"Wonderful notions of ivy leaves, citrus peel and conifer greet the nose. The aromatic impression leads onto a slender, dry and fluid palate that still seems tightly coiled and closed. But those subtle aromatic hints and a concentrated, stony palate promise future pleasure. This will blossom into a perfumed marvel. Drink 2019–2030.",95,65.0,Alsace
70636,Spain,"An obscure Catalonian wine made from indigenous grapes, this pricey oddball starts with bubblegum and candy aromas mixed with smoke and meat. The color is dark and the wine is a bit rough. But in a country, unusual way it redeems itself with zippy cherry flavors and a fresh, tight mouthfeel. Best with food.",87,49.0,Spain Other
70637,US,"An outstanding value in a top-level Oregon Chardonnay, this beautifully rendered, barrel-fermented wine is a showcase of sharply defined flavors. The tree fruits are highlighted with details of spice and new wood, clearly delineated and well-matched.",92,28.0,Oregon
70638,US,"Lots to like in this silky wine. It has a very pure, light feeling in the mouth, with pleasant cherry, cranberry, cola and sandalwood flavors. But it tastes too tutti-fruity sweet throughout, and turns candied on the finish.",87,38.0,California
70639,US,"Complex and meaty, this deeply colored Syrah from a family estate vineyard oozes flavors of toasted oak, pepper, grilled cherries (if there is such a thing) and grilled beef. There is more going on than just fruit and oak, as the earthy-spicy tones meld with fine-grain tannins. This kept getting better hours after opening and should mature well through 2018.",93,32.0,California
70640,US,"Kicks off with gobs of chocolate and spice aromas, then fans out to reveal layers of black currant, blackberry, coffee, herb and spice flavors. A touch of acidity accentuates the tannins, but the wine is richly textured, full bodied and delightful nonetheless. Full, ripe and distinctive.",92,48.0,California
70641,US,"Soft, silky and made in a delicate style, Horseshoe is all about forested earth, black tea and truffle, a delicate lining of orange peel accented in the background.

70642,US,"This is a distinctive Chardonnay, with pea vine and peach, anise and apple mixing it up.

Could be the best CV Chardonnay ever from L'Ecole.",91,22.0,Washington
70643,Chile,"Roasted, leathery berry aromas are dense, complex and include a tarry note of fresh asphalt. This Carmenère-led blend is both chewy and deep, complete with fine-grain tannins.

70644,US,"A lighthearted, refined and distinctive wine made from vineyards including Ritchie and Banfield, this white gets less time in oak than the single-vineyard designates, but sings in waxy apple, lemon, nutmeg and brioche. This is a pretty wine with a lot of soul.",92,46.0,California
70645,Australia,"Made in an elegant, filigreed style, this wine delivers understated hints of smoke, pear and melon. Given time in the glass, some peach notes emerge. Pleasantly plump on the midpalate, the flavors and textures tighten on the crisp finish.",90,33.0,Western Australia

70651,France,"Picture grandma standing over a pot of stewed prunes, which fill the dusty old house with their sickly aromas. Cooked, earthy and rustic, this wine has little going for it. Just barely acceptable.",80,11.0,Languedoc-Roussillon

70654,Austria,"The nose is closed, but the palate speaks of concentration and a stony core that is still tightly coiled. Once this is ready, it will unfurl into glorious lemon zest and oil notions. For now, this is taut and tight, secretive and closed. There is an implicit stony slenderness, which has a heart of generous fruit buried at its core. This comes with a great promise of future glory, immense direction and concentration. Drink 2020–2040.",95,65.0,Wachau
70655,US,"Complex and fascinating aromas suggesting cranberry, cedar and mushroom get your attention right away.

70680,Austria,"Yeasty funk initially plays over a whole mix of pink grapefruit, mandarin and lemon flavors. The citrus party continues on the palate, with zesty notes of citrus peel. Verve and freshness are kept only in slight check by a phenolic backbone and are driven on by the linear lemon freshness.

70696,Argentina,"Dry grainy, full-force oak aromas are front and center, with spiced apple notes playing in the backdrop.

70714,US,"Boysenberry, dried rose petals, lilac and lavender show on the nose of this iconic winery's affordable bottling. Pencil shavings show on the sip, where the dark purple and boysenberry fruits are cut by deft acidity.",87,19.0,California
70715,US,"Closed aromatically at first, this medium-bodied wine develops dark plum and cocoa notes amidst a juicy mid palate. Dusty tannins end things nicely. There's not a lot of red wine out there of this quality at this price.",88,14.0,California
70716,US,"This wine is made from grapes grown on the producer's RockRise Mountain vineyard, 1,100-feet up.

70719,South Africa,"A savory, masculine nose of black currant, cloves and spice lead into flavors of black fruit, spiced sausage and toast in this sexy Cabernet. Flavors are meaty, spicy but soft. Balanced but has a plucky, spicy backbone. Pair with lamb, steak, savory dishes.",90,38.0,Stellenbosch
70720,France,"Round and silky, this is a medium-bodied Saint-Joseph intended for early enjoyment. Blackberry and dusty earth shadings mingle easily on the palate, fading just a bit quickly on the finish.",85,28.0,Rhône Valley

70722,US,"Soft, silky and seductive, this qualifies as an outstanding everyday Pinot (by Oregon standards) that offers more subtle scent and flavor than most under-$30 bottles. Violets, cherries and star anise are mixed in the nose; the palate adds herbal and earthy nuances.",88,25.0,Oregon

70726,US,"Sineann's Wy'east designate continues on a roll in 2015, and is simply one of the finest values in any Oregon Pinot Noir.

Vivid berry fruit flavors bring pinpoint focus throughout a seemingly endless parade of flavors.",95,36.0,Oregon
70727,US,"This fragrant, thoroughly delicious blend is the most widely available offering from this esteemed grower/producer.

70735,France,"This is a pure Pinot Noir cuvée from an Aube-based producer. It has a curious candied character reminiscent of fruit drops due, perhaps, to its youth. Give it a few more months to gain depth and drink from 2018.",85,30.0,Champagne
70736,Italy,"A blend of Merlot, Corvina and Sangiovese, this opens with aromas of dark berry and a hint of cooking spice. The straightforward palate presents crushed black plum and clove alongside round tannins. Enjoy soon.",87,17.0,Veneto
70737,Italy,"Made with 60% Sangiovese, 30% Cabernet Sauvignon and 10% Merlot, this has a rather shy nose that slowly reveals aromas of fresh red berry, chopped herb and a whiff of espresso. The palate delivers black currant and white pepper notes accompanied by fine-grained tannins.",88,,Tuscany
70738,US,"There's too much of everything in this Cabernet. The fruit is massively extracted and sweetly jammy. The oak is a heavy plaster of sweet caramel. The result is impressive for sheer size, but unbalanced. Unlikely to improve with age.",84,49.0,California

70740,Spain,"Damp, rubbery aromas of berry fruits and cured meat amount to a weird ensemble. This is decidedly grabby on the palate, with salty, herbal plum flavors. A leafy, herbal, mildly green finish wraps up this kitchen-sink blend of Mencía and other grapes.",84,23.0,Galicia
70741,South Africa,"Despite the age of this wine, it's still bright and lively, with clean and upfront aromas and flavors of orange citrus, white melon rind, white peach and firm pear. The palate is vibrant and fresh, with mouthwatering acidity that follows through to the toast-laced finish.",88,21.0,Robertson
70742,Chile,"This Alcance Cab is arguably the best we've had from them to date.

A real mouthful, with toasty mocha and vanilla on the finish.",90,15.0,Maule Valley

70745,France,"From its privileged position right next to the grand cru of La Tâche, Aux Malconsorts has produced a heady, perfumed wine, relatively delicate, relying on its succulent red fruits to give body. It is on the sweet side of Pinot Noir, jammy with red berry flavors, and already delicious.",92,160.0,Burgundy
70746,US,"Greg Brewer goes for full restraint on this bottling, which offers extremely tight aromas of citrus and wet rocks, only barely revealing that it's a Chardonnay. The flavors are similarly restrained, with lemongrass and guava barely peeking out. Yet the texture is sublime and tightly wound, lifted by a fresh acidity.",91,48.0,California
70747,Chile,"There's something plaguing the nose here: talcum powder? air freshener? Whatever, it seems powdery and a touch artificial. The palate features soft flavors of green bean and orange juice, and the mild vegetal character carries onto the finish. Plump, with some friendliness, but a touch green.",85,18.0,Leyda Valley
70748,US,"Cigar-box spice, sandalwood, hibiscus, cinnamon, wild strawberries and black olive converge on the nose of this wine by Josh Jensen, who created the appellation single-handedly.

70751,France,This is ripe and fruity with attractive red-fruit flavors and a touch of tannins to keep it all in place. The wine is soft with just a layer of tannin and plenty of red cherries at the end.,88,28.0,Burgundy
70752,US,"A likeable, easy Pinot that straddles the line between simplicity and complexity. Darkly colored, with earthy, berry aromatics; in the mouth it has the soft, silky texture and crisp acids you want in a good Pinot. Flavors are of cherries and spices. Fruit-driven and a good accompaniment to a wide range of food.",86,21.0,California
70753,France,"This is a blend from several Grand Crus on the Corton hill. It is rich and spicy, with great black fruits and solid tannins. A powerful wine, it's shot through with acidity and black-plum fruits throughout the structure. Drink from 2023.",95,170.0,Burgundy
70754,US,"Cabernet Sauvignon (58%) and Syrah (34%) make up the majority of this wine, with the balance being pinches of Petit Verdot and Cabernet Franc. The aromas bring notes of vanilla, baking spice, graphite and black cherry, with the oak (85% new French) up front. Fruit and barrel play off each other well on the palate. The barrel influence isn't shy but it still brings a lot of enjoyment.",90,55.0,Washington
70755,France,"This is a ripe, fresh and fruity wine that's filled out with a tangy, mineral texture. Grapefruit and lime juice flavors give a zesty feel as well as intense acidity. It is ready to drink.",89,21.0,Loire Valley
70756,Argentina,"Having tasted the 2002 through the 2005, the '04 seems bright by comparison, with aromatics that include forest floor, tar and lively berries. The palate, like all the Poesia wines, is mouthfilling and substantial; flavors of black cherry, boysenberry and mocha are knit together and don't skip a beat.",92,80.0,Mendoza Province
70757,US,"This is the finest of the winery's three new rosés, and kudos to them for specializing in blush. The vineyard is in the Green Valley, and the wine shows long hangtime raspberry and cherry fruit, brightened with crisp acidity. It all leads to a dry, spicy finish, and the alcohol is a refreshingly low 13.2% by volume.",90,25.0,California
70758,US,"A harshly tannic wine; while there's a good hit of cherries, it's so tannic that it will never soften out.",83,22.0,California
70759,Chile,"All signs point in one direction: the top of the heap. This is one great Chilean red blend! With Syrah, Carmenère, Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot in the mix, Gê sets a new benchmark for multigrape blends from Chile. This wine is loaded with berry, cassis and black plum flavors, but it's textured, balanced and alluring. There's a bit of creaminess on the finish to offset any tannic bite that's still holding on, but as a whole it's delicious, generous and ready to go. Best now through 2011.",93,90.0,Colchagua Valley
70760,Italy,"This blend of Syrah and Merlot offers a trove of enticing aromas, including plum sauce, soya, spice, leather and ripe blueberries. Those blueberry tones continue in the mouth where the wine exhibits great freshness and intensity.",90,30.0,Tuscany
70761,US,"Although the wine is labeled a Vineyard Designate, it's a blend of multiple vineyards. Dry, fairly full-bodied and tannic, it has complex cherry, currant, licorice and sandalwood flavors. Drinkable now, it will benefit by waiting until 2017 in the cellar.",88,45.0,California
70762,Italy,"Made with equal parts Merlot, Cabernet Sauvignon, Cabernet Franc and Petit Verdot, this opens with aromas of red berry, mint and a whiff of kitchen spice.

70763,US,"This particular block was first planted in 2007, so these are young vines. Sometimes fruit from young vines will burst forth in spectacular fashion, and that's the case here. Supremely aromatic, this opens with a velvety mix of Asian spices, fruit leather, plum, cherry, cocoa powder and coffee grounds. All this and more can be tasted as well as sniffed, with excellent penetration through a lingering, cedary finish.",93,35.0,Oregon
70764,New Zealand,"This medium-bodied wine is tightly structured and bracingly acidic, yet doesn't lack for ripeness or fruit. Guava, gooseberry and grapefruit are all present from aromatic start to lengthy, focused finish. It's a crisp, refreshing counterpoint to some of Marlborough's softer styles of Sauvignon Blanc.",90,20.0,Marlborough
70765,France,"This wine displays weight, richness and intense fruits. It also has structure and a texture that offers a tangy, steely character. It's still young and needs to age, so drink from 2015.",87,,Loire Valley
70766,US,"In this intriguing wine blended with 10% Grenache, the aromas, flavors and feel aren't entirely connected. It's aromatically very reserved, with notes of mineral, coffee and red fruit. It has a incredibly supple, dazzling texture with the throttle pulled back on the alcohol and extraction.",90,34.0,Washington
70767,Argentina,"A sappy, jammy nose offers a nice entry to this simple blend of Cabernet and Merlot. The palate feel is regular and healthy, while the flavors run toward generic red fruits with a touch of green herbs and caramel. Snappy and crisp on the finish.",87,16.0,Other

70771,US,"This is a rustic Pinot Noir, soft and candied. It has raspberry, red plum and oak flavors. Finishes with a bit of heat from alcohol.",83,25.0,California
70772,France,"Under the same ownership as Château de Panigon, this property (which has a heart on its cork) has produced a wine offering layers of smoky wood as well as ripe fruit. That solid structure suggests the wine will need time to develop. The aftertaste boosts a more juicy fruitiness.",87,19.0,Bordeaux
70773,US,"This is an ambitiously lean style for a widely available brand, showing reserved tension. Aromas of yogurt and freshly-cut apple and nectarine give way to a steely palate of lime pith, flavors much more common on pricier bottlings.",88,15.0,California
70774,France,"Grown on chalk soil, this has a steely core that cuts through the more rounded, ripe tropical fruits. It's full and rich, balancing acidity and the full fruits. The aftertaste combines toast and freshness.",89,39.0,Burgundy
70775,US,"A young, 100% varietal and estate-farmed wine, this is a soft, thick and dusty gathering of chocolate and blackberry jam, filled in with wild game and leather.

70776,France,"Intensely ripe wine, with melon and pear flavors, spiced with just the right amount of wood and structured fruit skin tannins. So classy, this is a beautiful wine, boasting the richness of 2009 while still keeping a sense of nervy texture.",94,320.0,Burgundy

70778,Italy,"Made with 95% Malvasia and 5% Sangiovese, this opens with aromas of resin, dried fruit and flaky pastry. On the sweet but rather fresh palate, clover honey and pine nut accent a core of mature apricot.",88,44.0,Tuscany
70779,France,"Ripe and perfumed, this is packed with the richness of 2010 along with its structure. It has weight, juicy black and red berry fruits and a tense structure that still needs time. Acidity at the end provides a fresh lift to the essentially firm wine.",87,13.0,Bordeaux
70780,Italy,"This rosso has a pretty bouquet of fruit and floral aromas, with an underpinning of spice. The palate is soft, with ripe plum, cinnamon and chocolate flavors, and while well made, it doesn't have a lot of personality. This is ripe and ready, so enjoy soon.",87,15.0,Tuscany
70781,France,"Smooth and balanced, this wine brings together generous red fruits and fresh acidity. Underneath, attractive, dry tannins give shape to this otherwise ready-to-drink, fruity wine.

70784,US,"This block-designate wine shows flamboyant aromas of red cherry, cola, purple flowers and light caramel.

The texture is soft, but lifted by strong acidity.",96,64.0,California
70785,US,"This wine is expressive, with aromas of violet, herb and purple fruit. The palate is lighter styled and tart, delivering a bit more tannic heft than this variety often shows. Give it some time to open up.",90,20.0,Washington
70786,US,"This single clone, single-block wine offers a well-defined, tight and concentrated streak of pretty cherry fruit. It's underpinned with minerality, and carries on through a clear, crisp finish.",88,49.0,Oregon
70787,US,"From a hilltop location near the ocean-influenced town of Freestone, this wine is silky in plum and dark cherry, a hint of mushroomed earth doing its best to come out. Robust on the palate, juicy berry fruit satisfies, finishing thick and rich.",88,60.0,California
70788,Austria,"Intriguing notes of orange flower make for a delicate opening that segues into soft apricot notes. This is elegant and delicate, yet not without direction or concentration. There is warmth, too, and the vivacious Riesling acidity is cushioned by ripeness. The finish is earthy and long.",92,40.0,Kremstal

70790,France,"Tender notes of lemon and glorious freshness are first apparent on the shy nose but achieve their full expression on the slender, dry and incisive palate. The purity of the lemon zest notes tingles on the tongue and creates a streamlined, refreshing dynamic. This is clean and invigorating with its uncompromising bright freshness that lasts and lasts. This is lovely now but has huge promise. Drink 2017–2037.",94,39.0,Alsace
70791,US,"Cabernet clones 6, 8 and 191 make up the majority of this wine. The aromas show some reduction out of the gate. This is followed by a medium-bodied, acid driven palate, with clove, cherry, wood spice and herb flavors. There's intrigue but it doesn't all quite come together. That said, it should fit in well at the dinner table.",89,50.0,Washington
70792,France,"Owned by Guigal but made at a separate facility, Vidal-Fleury's 2005 Crozes-Hermitage offers plummy aromas of superripe fruit, but lacks any midpalate richness. It's a crisp, medium-bodied Syrah with a supple, easy-to-like finish.",86,18.0,Rhône Valley

70796,US,"Smells and tastes just great, with all the hallmarks of an important Napa Cabernet. It's rich in blackberries, black currants, cassis and minerals. Near- perfect tannins and a tasteful overlay of sweet oak add textural complexity. For all that, the wine feels young and brusque. It wants 6–7 years of age to begin to strut its stuff. Open after 2012.",93,70.0,California
70797,US,"Passionfruit dominates the nose on winemaker Matt Ortman's tropically infused take on the grape, with a dash of kiwi to lighten things up. That tropicality rules the palate as well, but with a touch of flint as a grounding element.",89,14.0,California
70798,US,"Don't discount this Pinot Noir because it's in a screw top and the price is under $20. It's quite a nice wine, dry and silky. Made in a lighter style to be opened now, it has pleasant cherry, cola and sandalwood flavors.",86,18.0,California

70800,US,"The winery's Affinity bottling has had mixed results over the years, but this is one of their best, right up there with the 2007. It's a beautiful wine, absolutely dry, tannic, smooth and complex in black currant flavor.

70801,France,"White peach, cherry and cranberry fruits are coupled with attractive scents of white tea, talc and peony on the nose of this wine. There's a subtle texture to the lightweight palate, thanks to notes of lime pith and bitter melon rind. It's well balanced and easy to like.",87,,Languedoc-Roussillon
70802,Italy,"A flashy, modern-style wine, Modus takes traditional Tuscan flavors of leather and tobacco, dresses them up with cassis, vanilla and toast and wraps all that in a cocoon of lush, supple tannins.

70807,US,"Coming from one of the state's top Syrah sites, this wine starts out quite aromatically closed up, with notes of brambly blue fruit and herbs, along with whiffs of orange peel and smoked meat.

Give it some time to open up and it delivers.",92,40.0,Washington
70808,France,"This wine continues the improvements at this classed growth chateau at the far southern end of the Margaux appellation.

70811,US,"Once again, the amazing Stillwater Creek vineyard comes through with a highly expressive, pure and intense Syrah that captures the heart and soul of a Washington State take on the grape.

In the end, the fruit and acidity are dulled by the toffee and oak and grippy, grizzled leather in this wine.",85,40.0,California
70817,US,"Although this wine earns its reserve designation with extra concentration, it comes at the cost of complexity. The tart rhubarb and cranberry flavors are tight and the mouthfeel blocky; the wine seems to hit a wall and stop at the stiff tannins.",88,45.0,Oregon
70818,Italy,"A simple, citrusy quaff that leans heavily toward pineapple and grapefruit. Some melon flavors round out the package.",84,12.0,Northeastern Italy
70819,US,"On a par with recent vintages, this four-year old Cab is soft and pleasant, with ripe cherry, blackberry, raspberry and herb flavors that are well oaked. The tannins are crunchy, but the wine isn't an ager. Best now through 2009.",87,27.0,California

70824,US,"Light cherry and strawberry aromas and flavors go with a medium-body and grippy texture to make this wine rather tight on the palate. It's a good, versatile lunch and dinner drink because the supportive tannins and acidity will pair nicely with food.",88,85.0,California
70825,US,"Tastes rich and flashy now, with a rich array of oranges, pineapples and peaches, accented with oak. The acidity is just fine. Hanzell Chardonnays have a history of aging, so try stashing it for six years and see what happens.",88,75.0,California
70826,Chile,"Heavy pear and apple aromas pound the olfactory senses, prior to citrus and Bosc pear flavors. In its favor, the acids are bright, which keeps the wine's weight and feel in balance. There's also an appealing flinty nuance, which will make it go well with shellfish and salads.",83,,Lontué Valley
70827,France,"This ripe and full-bodied wine has weight as well as fine fruits. It is juicy, still fresh with its acidity and still structured. Aging for 12 months in large barrels has given an extra richness as well as broadening the fruitiness. Drink from 2019.",90,21.0,Loire Valley

70830,US,"Rich in tropical fruit and citrus flavors and generously oaked, this Chardonnay is made in the modern style, designed to appeal. It's dry and properly crisp, with a fine minerality, but is overworked. You can feel the heavy hand of the winemaker.",86,40.0,California
70831,US,"This is the finest Cabernet from Gordon Estate in some time; forward and pretty, with a juicy mix of red fruits. The raspberry and cherry and currant flavors are nicely defined and deep, underscored with crisp acidity, and showing the sort of youthful concentration that suggests further cellaring is in order. Nonetheless, it's a wine to enjoy right away simply for its luscious, exuberant fruit.",91,26.0,Washington
70832,US,"Showing a lot of barrel toast in both nose and mouth, this backs its buttered apple flavor with plenty of acidity. It's like biting into a crisp-tasting slice of apple pie; delicious now, or hold for another 4–6 years.",91,45.0,Oregon

It is smooth on the palate, with fruit and floral notes playing off each other. The lengthy, sophisticated finish wraps up on a nice bright note.",89,27.0,Judean Hills
70835,US,"To judge by the blast of white pepper and strong tannins, the Northern Rhône is the model for this dry, single-vineyard wine. It is a distinguished Syrah, but too tannic and closed down now for thorough enjoyment. Best to cellar for 3 or 4 years, maybe longer, until it throws some sediment.",90,32.0,California
70836,US,"Clove and vanilla make for a serious, if not terribly refreshing, opening. There's nice grapefruit and pomelo fruit here and a medium, lemony finish that veers towards tart. Drink up.",84,26.0,New York
70837,US,"Enveloped in toasted oak aromas, this reserve-tier wine tingles with acidity and refreshing, high-toned fruit.

70838,Spain,"Among Genium's fine lineup of 2010 Priorat reds, this one stands out for it's schisty nose of cherry, currant and raspberry. A ripe, layered, chiseled palate is tough but rewarding.

70844,Argentina,"Smells like corn stalks and also of oxidation. The palate is wet but shapeless, and the flavors are waxy and jumbled. It's yet another pass-it-by, underperforming Mendoza Chardonnay.",80,14.0,Mendoza Province
70845,US,"Sourced from the Martinelli family's Charles Vineyard out on the coast, this is a gorgeously rich and balanced white wine, whole-cluster fermented and given just less than a quarter of new French oak.

70853,Chile,"Sweaty leather, stewed berry, green herb and earth aromas set up a fresh, tomato-like and raw palate. On the flavor profile, this deals equal parts earth, dry spice, green peppercorn and red-fruit notes. A simple finish is adequately dry and spicy.",86,20.0,Casablanca Valley
70854,US,"This wine is a blend of fruit from the Bacchus (57%), Dionysus (22%) and Olsen (21%) vineyards. The aromas are vibrant, with notes of lime zest, white peach, apple and mineral, along with whiffs of reduction. It drinks dry, with a sleek high-acid styling. Stone-fruit flavors linger on the finish. Pair it with food to see it at its best.",90,18.0,Washington

70856,Greece,"Black cherry, cigarbox and balsamic on the nose is followed by red currant, leather and cherry on the palate. A touch of lean minerality and lots of acidity give the wine a plucky kick. If you like leaner-style reds with an exotic flair, this wine is for you.",84,20.0,Cephalonia

70861,US,"Very opulent, almost too much so, with a flood of Key lime pie, pineapple jam, orange, butterscotch and buttered toast flavors that overwhelm in richness. The saving grace is a fine structure of acidity and minerals and a finish that strives to be dry. Drink now with shellfish, roast pork, or all alone as an apéritif.",90,30.0,California
70862,Brazil,"This is mentholated and spicy, with a brandied cherry note as the dominant aroma. Tight but not too severe, it would pair well with meat.

70874,Argentina,"Earthy and showing clay, milk chocolate, baked cherry and mocha aromas and flavors, and while the wine feels fairly smooth it doesn't do much but lay there on the palate.

70883,Argentina,"Pungent, yeasty, almost sweaty notes of onion and garlic blend with oak-infused cider and citrus aromas.

70924,US,"This blend of 60% Cabernet Sauvignon, 20% Syrah and smaller amounts of Merlot, Malbec and Petit Verdot shows prominent black cherry, cedar and licorice flavors, along with a streak of tobacco. Full bodied and moderate in acidity, it finishes simply.",87,48.0,California
70925,US,"Smoked nuts and earth tones lend savoriness to ripe black-cherry and blackberry flavors. Subtle spice and licorice mark the midpalate, leading to a bold, grippy finish.",88,40.0,New York
70926,Australia,"Operative words to describe this wine might include seamless and harmonious. There's such wonderful integration of fruit and oak that it's difficult to pick this wine's flavor components apart—it's a whirl of cassis and cedar, yet restrained; full-bodied, rich and dense without being heavy. Long and velvety on the finish, with enough soft tannins to last it 10–15 years.",93,75.0,Western Australia
70927,France,"Rich black fruits are supported by a dark structure and intensely juicy, youthful acidity. It is powerful, ripe and full of potential. Definitely young with its exuberant fruit, it is going to need serious aging. Drink this wine from 2020.",95,262.0,Burgundy
70928,Germany,"Firm and steely in structure yet decadently fruity, this light-footed Spätlese offers substance and pleasure in spades. Luscious yellow-peach and tangerine flavors are plush on the palate but balanced judiciously with racy acidity and a deep tang of minerality. Gorgeous already but could hold well through 2021.",92,22.0,Nahe
70929,US,"Joined by 8% Cabernet Sauvignon, this stellar wine from an almost 50-50 Napa-Sonoma divide delivers big flavor and tannin and yet exudes vibrant juicy plum and blueberry, keeping it grounded and alive. Silky through and through, it's complex in dark chocolate and a touch of dried herbs.",91,60.0,California
70930,US,"This is a delightfully fresh yet creamy wine that delivers a spectrum of styles and flavors. Anise and tart apple notes accent the floral-driven experience, unfettered by oak, which plays but a supporting role.",91,50.0,California
70931,US,"This is the darkest, biggest, richest of Raymond's 2007 Cabernets. It's ripe and full in blackberries and currants, with a thick coating of sweet, toasty oak, but it's not really drinkable now because the tannins are so strong. Designed for the cellar, it should develop bottle complexity over the next 10–12 years.",92,85.0,California
70932,US,"The blend includes 6% Syrah, and the wine has a pretty plum and blueberry color, that (perhaps by the power of suggestion) carries through into the aromas. It's tight, tart, and clean, offering a mix of berry fruits and a finish lined with vanilla and tobacco. Overall the balance is excellent, the wine juicy and fresh, and the blend just about perfect.",87,8.0,Washington
70933,France,"Delicate herbal accents add depth to the fruity tones of apple flesh, pear and white nectarine. The palate is surprisingly round and toasty, with rich baked apple and peach pit flavors that fall somewhat flat on the midpalate. Drink now.",85,13.0,Languedoc-Roussillon
70934,Israel,"Black cherry to the eye, this wine has a bouquet of raspberry and Mediterranean herbs with a strong note of lavender. It is well-crafted, with flavors of cherry, blackberry, smoked meat, thyme and black pepper. Silky tannins line the palate, and the finish offers a burst of cranberry and pomegranate.",92,50.0,Judean Hills
70935,US,"Just slightly off-dry, this excellent bottle mixes its ripe lemon, orange and papaya fruit with breakfast tea-like flavors. Its acidity is ample enough to keep the sweetness at bay, making it a fine, all-purpose wine that should please a wide variety of palates.",91,20.0,Oregon
70936,US,"Delicate flavors of pressed apples, pears and lemon are accented by exotic hints of spice and potpourri in this dry, single-vineyard Riesling. It's not deeply concentrated, but zesty acidity makes it refreshingly crisp. Drink now–2016.",86,20.0,New York
70937,US,"The very tannic '05 reserve is a blend of Petit Verdot, Cab Sauvignon, Merlot and Cab Franc. It's fleshy and rich in blackberry, cassis and tobacco flavors, with lots of new toasty oak, and there's something meaty, like ground hamburger with a splash of tamari. Utterly delicious and very fine, this low-production bottling should evolve over many years.",93,100.0,California
70938,New Zealand,"Winemaker Blair Walter has dialed up the intensity in this powerfully concentrated bottling, which packs ample black-cherry fruit and sturdy notes of hickory smoke, cured meat and dark coffee. Despite the wine's considerable weight, the tannins are supple enough to make it approachable now.",92,79.0,Central Otago
70939,Chile,"Complexity on the nose comes via earthy aromas of licorice root, sandalwood and mild berry fruits. The palate is on the big and bullish side, but it's neither heavy nor fierce. Flavors of ripe blackberry, pepper and chocolate finish with a touch of herbs and mint. Drink through 2017.",90,22.0,Buin
70940,US,"Pleasantly fruity and almost sweet, this medium-bodied wine offers a fruit bowl of flavor and freshness on the palate.",86,9.0,California
70941,US,"The vineyard is relatively new, and the block from which this wine was made is entirely Dijon clone 777. It's a rich, fruit-forward wine, brimming with crushed cherry pulp and black raspberries, to which charred oak barrels have lent richer notes of mocha. The wine also is quite dry and acidic and even tannic, in Farrell's usual style. That should lend it ageworthiness.",91,50.0,California
70942,Italy,"The millennial vintage of Campora (Cabernet Sauvignon) is understated in an elegant way and doles out measured aromas of dried fruit, prune, strawberry tart and spice. It's a lighter style, making it suited for white meat or pasta dishes.",87,,Tuscany
70943,US,"This estate Chardonnay is keeping stylistically with the winery's other offerings, though a tad weightier and richer in oak and crème brûlée. Fresh peach, pineapple and anise intermingle on the palate, with a silky yet complex texture. There is a palate-refreshing hint of lime on the finish.",93,29.0,California
70944,New Zealand,"Made in a ready-to-drink, approachable style, this would be a fine introduction to Hawke's Bay/Gimblett Gravels Syrah. Blueberries, mulberries and spices abound, while hints of espresso and dark chocolate appear on the softly dusty finish. Drink this medium-bodied wine now through 2020.",91,35.0,Hawke's Bay
70945,US,"Somewhat restrained aromas of dried cranberry and pomegarante mix with light herbs and spices on the nose of this bottling. It's vibrant, fun and easy-to-drink on the palate, where the simple red-fruit flavors make it perfect for the beach or poolside.",87,21.0,California
70946,US,"At 160g/L residual sugar, this late-harvest wine brings plenty of sweetness with its lightly spritzy marmalade, orange peel and pear aromas and flavors, yet it still retains an appealing sense of lightness and balance as well. The length is impressive.",91,40.0,Washington
70947,US,"Half Cabernet Franc and 25% each Tannat and Malbec, this rough-and-tumble red is tannic and earthy. That tannic stiffness might subside with further bottle age, but this wine may be best opened soon and served with spicy, hearty food.",85,42.0,Oregon
70948,US,"Welcoming and easy to drink, this full-bodied wine has mellow, ripe fruit flavors, light oaky accents and a warm sense of ripeness that doesn't go over the top. Subtle tannins support the texture while keeping it smooth. The blend includes Zinfandel, Syrah, Cabernet Sauvignon and Petite Sirah.",89,11.0,California
70949,US,"Lovely scents of violet and black fruit open this dark, sappy Syrah. The mouthfeel is sleek and citrusy, with sharp acidity and a finish amplified by barrel-influenced flavors of coffee and licorice. Give this some extra decanting time and it will open up further.",88,30.0,Washington
70950,US,"Smells thin and sweaty-funky, with little flavor, except the heat of alcohol. Maybe there's a drop of cherries.",81,28.0,California
70951,Germany,"Intense minerality penetrates through the nose and palate of this dry, remarkably bold Riesling, highlighting notes of fresh pineapple and white grapefruit. The mouthfeel is creamy and viscous, but bitter lemon pith and herb notes lend balance and complexity. Drink now through 2016.",91,46.0,Rheinhessen
70952,US,"A gorgeous Pinot Noir, dry and crisp in cool-climate acidity, with a silky texture housing complex cherry and raspberry fruit flavors. Oak adds lush vanilla and toast notes. Really lovely now, and should develop over the next six years.",94,70.0,California
70953,US,"Great potential is evident in this young wine from a recently planted vineyard. Spicy cranberry and raspberry fruit shines forth, buoyed by natural acidity. The weight and fruit intensity are just right, and the wine shows excellent depth of flavor, with a finishing lick of cocoa.",89,30.0,Oregon
70954,Germany,"This TBA features almost endless variations on the sugary theme: caramelized sugar, demarara syrup and honey all swirl together, wrapped around a bit of citrusy acidity. A distinctly musky spice note adds interest. Drink now–2040.",93,250.0,Mosel
70955,France,"Perfume partners with great acidity in this wine. The two work in harmony, resulting in a wine that has a soft texture, rich, jammy berry fruits and a backbone of tannins that will allow for aging. Drink from 2017.",93,60.0,Burgundy
70956,US,"This was a difficult vintage in Washington, and the style of this dry Riesling seems to have changed significantly, perhaps as a result. The grapefruit flavors have no body or texture; it's light, certainly refreshing, but rather simple.",85,9.0,Washington
70957,US,"Some superripe notes give this wine a raisin-skin bitterness, but there's no denying its immediate lushness. Softly tannic, it has fantastic flavors of black currants and sweet toasted oak. If you drink it now, give it a few hours in the decanter.",89,92.0,California
70958,Chile,"With no oak for makeup, this smells natural and a touch stalky, with melony fruit scents. The full, healthy palate is naturally creamy but also braced by bold acidity. Fresh flavors of citrus, apple and melon finish a bit salty.",87,13.0,San Antonio
70959,Chile,"A note of brine rests on top on an otherwise dry, earthy, red-fruit bouquet. Punchy tannins create mild pinch, while earthy plum flavors carry a note of leather. A crisp, zesty finish with mild oak and spice notes closes this out.",87,10.0,Maule Valley
70960,Chile,"Pear and apple aromas receive a kick from some creamy, vanilla-tinged oak. The palate is mostly tangerine and lime, with some rich baked-apple undertones. The lengthy finish is solid, as is the mouthfeel. Best Buy.",85,8.0,Central Valley
70961,US,"Dry, tough in tannins and acidic, this Merlot isn't offering much now. Despite a rich, concentrated vein of cherries, it's a hard, almost old-fashioned wine. Your best bet is to age it, but no guarantees. Try after 2012.",86,35.0,California
70962,France,"88-90 Soft, ripe, smooth, with delicious acidity and berry fruits. Some good density.",89,,Bordeaux
70963,France,"Solid tannins and rich fruit come together in this ripe, still-young wine. It has good potential, with bold black fruit and a dense, mineral texture. It will need several years for those tannins to soften. Drink from 2021.",88,15.0,Bordeaux
70964,Argentina,"Fruity on the nose, with a friendly mix of pineapple, apple, melon and powdered sugar aromas. Feels smooth and round but not heavy, with good acidity and likable, simple flavors of melon, banana and apple. There's a light note of toast on the finish.",87,13.0,Mendoza Province
70965,France,"Right next door to Mouton Rothschild, this small property is producing wines that are dominated by the rich, firm Cabernet Sauvignon of Pauillac. The weight and density are very present, a solid dry core surrounded by delicious black currant fruits. A wine that will mature relatively fast because of the vintage.",90,112.0,Bordeaux
70966,US,"Made entirely from Cinsault, this copper-orange-colored wine comes in a swank square bottle, but delivers a tart, sour quality that veers slightly metallic.",83,40.0,California
70967,US,"This is a Cab-based Bordeaux blend, and it shows Paso's ability to produce a ripe, gentle red wine that's immediately appealing. There's a nice earthiness to the cassis flavors, and a rich, tannic structure that makes you dream of a perfectly broiled steak or chop, brushed with brown butter sauce with a touch of garlic.",87,30.0,California
70968,Australia,"Lime zest and green apple mark this wine's nose and palate, dominating the senses at this early stage of the wine's evolution. A bit of dustiness emerges on the long, dry finish.",89,17.0,South Australia
70969,France,"This spicy, toasty wine currently shows more wood than fruit. Hints of yellow fruits are already there, so the texture should open to give a riper, fruitier wine. Give it until 2020.",89,59.0,Burgundy
70970,US,"There is distinct black pepper on the nose, as well as fresh raspberry and a minty strawberry sense. There is mild but noticeable tannic grip, tongue-dancing acidity and great flavors, ranging from plum pie to charred beets.",92,55.0,California
70971,US,"Another of the producer's 100% varietal wines, this hails from a tiny site at the base of Spring Mountain. Juicy and delicious, it offers a mix of ripeness and savory complexity, with layers of soft, integrated cranberry, blueberry, cassis and sage, the acidity balanced and nicely uplifting.",92,130.0,California
70972,US,"Merlot and Cabernet Sauvignon each make up 45% of this wine, with the balance Malbec. It comes off as quite green, with notes of bell pepper and green herb, along with unusual mesquite flavors. The alcohol pokes through on both the aromas and palate.",83,30.0,Washington
70973,US,"Hailing from a single vineyard in Michigan's southern AVA, this is a Cabernet Sauvignon-dominant blend (77%), with Cabernet Franc, Merlot and Petite Verdot making up the difference. This has cooked-down bramble berry aromas on the nose, and also brings to mind twings and stems. The medium-bodied palate shows a bit more character, with juicy black berry and red currant flavors elevated over green peppercorn and medium-grained tannins.",86,45.0,Michigan
70974,France,"Rhône-based négociant Jean-Luc Colombo has crafted this fleshy, ripe and round rosé from a blend of 40% Syrah, 40% Mourvèdre and 20% Counoise. It's got plenty of cherry fruit, but that's balanced by hints of minerality and a touch of fresh lime on the finish.",88,13.0,Provence
70975,Italy,"This blend of 75% Sangiovese, 20% Merlot and Cabernet Sauvignon and 5% Colorino opens with aromas that recall underbrush, woodland berries and tobacco leaf. The bright palate delivers tart sour cherry punctuated with white pepper and clove alongside supple tannins. It's already very drinkable so enjoy soon.",89,25.0,Tuscany
70976,Germany,"While sprightly in body and texture, this intensely concentrated, medium-sweet Riesling offers powerful fruit intensity offset by toe-tingling acidity. Ripe, luscious apricot and yellow-peach flavors are fresh, lingering on the finish with hints of sweet biscuit and caramel.",93,64.0,Mosel
70977,US,"This rich, mouth-filling wine starts with almost-sweet floral, plummy, oaky aromas, building toward ripe cherry, strawberry and black plum flavors and a smooth texture. Everything, from its deep color to its lingering finish, suggests a bold personality.",92,35.0,California
70978,US,"From a different block of the same vineyard as the “Whale label” Memorista, this is drinking much better at the moment. It's smooth and supple—a pretty wine with honeyed minerality around fruit flavors of citrus and peaches.",92,25.0,Oregon
70979,Argentina,"Inky aromas of black fruits include hints of graphite. This feels lush and dense, with fairly soft tannins. Blackberry, beef jerky and leathery notes comprise the flavor profile. Notes of coffee and chocolate grace a ripe, rich finish. Drink through 2021.",92,99.0,Mendoza Province
70980,US,"Superripe in raspberries and cherries, with a strong coating of sweet, smoky oak, this Pinot Noir is a little lacking in subtlety. But it has excellent acidity, minerality and even some firm tannins, and that structure gives it elegance. A bit brusque now, but will be fascinating to watch it develop over the next six years.",91,40.0,California
70981,US,"Dryish and crisp, this shows citrus, lemongrass, herb and honey flavors, with a sweet bitterness that will play well with a wide range of food, especially modern Asian fare.",86,24.0,California
70982,Austria,"Ripe yellow pear fruit is shot through with lemony freshness, a counterpoint between ripeness and acidity. Concentrated and streamlined, it offers a very moreish body with a lip-smacking finish.",90,25.0,Kremstal
70983,US,"This Pinot Noir, named for a particular soil type in the Willamette valley, is scented strongly of the lumber smell you get at a building supplies store. There is a simple but pleasing layer of strawberry/raspberry fruit hidden in the wine's core. Perhaps a year or two of bottle age will pull things together.",87,30.0,Oregon
70984,US,"This wine is 100% varietal, all aged in once-used French oak. It's packed to the brim with black fruit, herbs, licorice, jalapeño pepper and barrel spices, with crystalline clarity to the aromas. There's plenty of depth and richness to the full-bodied flavors, with exquisite balance and a finish that lingers.",92,28.0,Washington
70985,US,"Made from 100% Syrah and aged in 100% new French oak, this wine is currently hard, astringent and oaky, with caramel, vanilla and buttered toast aromas and flavors. The actual Syrah itself is clean and pure in ripe blackberry jam. Might do something over the years, but probably best now, with a decant.",87,75.0,California
70986,US,"In 2008, Januik made a single-vineyard Syrah from Lewis Vineyard fruit; now the winery has sourced fruit from Ciel du Cheval Vineyard, one of the superstar spots on Red Mountain. A compact wine that snaps right into focus, this offers varietal flavors of fig, berry and plum. A streak of smooth chocolate weaves through the finish, along with a hint of red licorice and underlying slate-like minerality.",92,35.0,Washington
70987,Germany,"Ripe and richly fruity, with chunky flavors of oranges, honey and tropical fruit tinged with hints of mineral and orange pekoe tea. It's a lush mouthful of easy-to-enjoy fruit.",90,20.0,Mosel-Saar-Ruwer
70988,US,"An offbeat blend of red and white varieties, this is a simple, fruity, tart wine. The raspberry and cherry flavors have an edge of lime acidity.",84,24.0,California
70989,US,"Good and rich and classy, with excellently ripe blackberry, currant and herb flavors and a nice overlay of toasty oak. Tannins are as fine as can be, smooth and complex, although they're young and tend to stun the palate.",91,40.0,California
70990,France,"Pure red fruit seems to have a bruised apple edge. The palate is simple and easy-drinking and despite its pretty ruby color comes across as a rosé, with barely a touch of tannin. Chill this for a surprise at a party.",86,17.0,Alsace
70991,US,"This is the winery's basic Cabernet, a blend of five vineyards on the mountain. It's a smooth, elegant, classic mountain Cab, that's dry and tannic, with delicious blackberry, currant and sweet-smoky oak flavors. It's right up there with Von Strasser's vineyard-designated wines that cost nearly twice as much, which makes it a great value.",92,45.0,California
70992,France,"This starts off shy, but with time allows aromas of delicate peach, cherry and orange blossom to come through in the bouquet. Pleasant ripe-fruit flavors unfold on the clean, well-balanced palate, with lingering notes of peach pit and orange peel on the finish.",88,13.0,Languedoc-Roussillon
70993,France,"Bright citrus-fruit flavors are rounded with warm apple and pear notes on this densely textured, fruity wine. It shows no sign of aging, with a palate that's still fresh and bright, and revealing its minerality and tight acidity slowly. Drink through 2020.",91,90.0,Champagne
70994,France,"The wine seems hollow, showing structure without fruit weight. Very dry and extracted, it is likely to remain hard.",84,,Bordeaux
70995,US,"With very ripe pineapple and pear flavors, this Chard also has a taste like cheddar cheese-dusted buttered popcorn. Crisp acidity helps to provide balance.",84,18.0,California
70996,US,"This is the small-production, flagship wine from the Sierra region's best producer of Rhône-style wines. Lovely, spicy, floral aromas and generous, complex and layered flavors make the wine irresistible, while its strong but velvety texture sets it up for a long life in the cellar for those who can resist. It smells lightly oaky, like a cigar box and cocoa, tastes deep and focused on blackberry, pomegranate and dark chocolate. The mouthfeel is both rich and a bit reserved. Best to drink from 2020 to 2030.",96,90.0,California
70997,France,"Produced just north of Sancerre, this wine shares many of the fresh, lightly herbal characters of those wines, just on a smaller, softer scale. Fruity with lemon zest and crisp acidity, it is ready to drink now, though will be better from late 2016.",86,16.0,Loire Valley
70998,US,"There's a palate-warming generosity to this single-vineyard Pinot, a result of its softly balanced texture and the smoothness of new oak. Luxurious flavors of smoky cherries and currants, roasted nuts, molasses and honey taste almost like an energy fruit bar from the health food store. This lovely, supple wine should develop through 2012.",90,58.0,California

71000,US,"Whiffs of earth and mushroom against a backdrop of intensely aromatic red cherry, fresh herb and spice hint to the future of this bold, complex Bordeaux blend.

71001,Argentina,"Compact, concentrated aromas of licorice, wild brush, fresh herbs, lemon peel and cassis come in front of a high-acid, juicy, racy palate.

71003,Chile,"Blackberry and raspberry aromas are spicy but mostly focus on good fruit character. This wine is evenly balanced, with firm tannins and bright acidity. Spicy, chocolaty flavors of black fruits finish with a not-too-forceful dash of brown sugar. Drink through 2024.",91,39.0,Maipo Valley
71004,Italy,"This robust red opens with aromas of ripe black-skinned fruit, scorched earth and dark cooking spice. The warm, forward palate offers black cherry marinated in spirits and licorice accompanied by ripe, velvety tannins. Unfortunately, the heat of searing alcohol throws it off balance and dominates the palate.",87,27.0,Sicily & Sardinia
71005,US,"Vanilla, toast and stone-fruit aromas are followed by light, elegantly styled flavors that show persistence. It comes off as a bit faint but what's there is pleasing.",87,15.0,Washington
71006,US,"A lovely bottle, carefully crafted from vines approaching 40 years of age. A third of the wine was fermented in neutral barrels, softening the mouthfeel a bit, and kept on the lees for almost five months. Apples and pears, melon and grapefruit all seem to have been mixed in with wet stones; the wine makes a fresh and delicate impression with as much mineral and fruit. Stylish and lacy.",89,21.0,Oregon
71007,US,"While the nose takes some time to open, crisp lemon, green apple and pear on the palate are vital and fresh here. It's a zingy, brut-style sparkling wine made entirely from Chardonnay with bold, mouthfilling foam. Delicate caramel and sugar cookie tones embellish a long finish.",90,44.0,New York
71008,US,"The nose is still emerging on this bottling by the historic estate, but nectarine, white and yellow flowers and a touch of cantaloupe are starting to peek out. The flavors dance between acidity and ripeness, with green apple flesh, lemon-lime peels and brisk minerality that build into a juicy finish.",91,26.0,California
71009,US,"The entry-level Pinot in the Ayoub lineup would be the top cuvée for any number of wineries. Full and fruity, with rich cherry flavors backed with defining minerality, it's powerful, deep and immaculately clear.",93,38.0,Oregon
71010,Spain,"Aromas of yeast, talcum powder and grass set up a palate of pithy citrus and pyranzinic flavors that are green and grassy. The finish on this Sauvignon Blanc, a grape you don't see too often in hot Jumilla, is green-flavored and snappy.",84,11.0,Levante
71011,US,"Mellow and reserved at first, this clonal study shows wet river stone and key lime scents on the nose. The palate leads with slightly sour lemon and orange rind flavors, opening into a sweeter honeysuckle tone and finishing on ripe peach, melon and toasted nut.",88,34.0,California

71013,South Africa,"Only 95 cases were made of this Bordeaux-style blend of 43% Cabernet Sauvignon, 33% Malbec and 24% Cabernet Franc. It's a stellar example of the high-end and highly cellarable wines that can come out of South Africa, oozing with depth, concentration and complexity, all in a harmonious, balanced package. It's dark and brooding right off the bat, boasting firm, tight blackberry, cherry and cassis fruit that's coupled with hints of raspberry sauce, pressed violets and baking spice. The palate is strong and packed with black fruit flavors that lead into a long, evolving finish of char, espresso bean, cigar and woodspice. Firmly structured and robust in feel, try from 2022–2028, though it could mature well even beyond.",95,330.0,Stellenbosch
71014,US,"This leads with light baking spice and apple pie aromas. The palate is broad, with abundant vanilla flavors that suggest strong oak influence.",87,17.0,Washington
71015,US,"This recent addition to the lineup at DeLille blends Cabernet from Klipsun, Ciel du Cheval, Grand Ciel and Upchurch vineyards. It's a fine effort, structured like the scaffolding on a high-rise building, narrow and vertical, with a spine of steel and a core of cassis. Firm acidity completes the picture.",91,65.0,Washington
71016,Germany,"Swirls of penetrating peach and honey flavors pack a mighty punch in this dazzling, sunny sip. Off dry in style, it's an easy going yet elegant wine accented by saffron, blossoms and reverberating tangerine acidity. Drink now through 2017.",90,20.0,Mosel
71017,US,"It's 100% Merlot, and it doesn't need any help from any other grapes. Extremely dark and thick in the mouth, this liquorous bruiser of a Merlot is thoroughly delicious. It's just packed with fruit, cassis and ripe black cherries, complemented by dark chocolate notes.",91,28.0,Washington
71018,US,"Although it's not on a par with Frog's Leap recent Cabernets, this '06 still is a nice glass of wine. It's dry and pretty tannic, with easy flavors of black currants and cedar. Might develop some bottle complexities over the next few years.",88,42.0,California
71019,US,"Made from 84% Cabernet Sauvignon and 16% Syrah, this up-front wine offers aromas of herbs, dried cherry and woodspice. The dark fruit flavors are rich, layered and focused, with the tannins tightly wound, seeming to need more time in the cellar to come into their own.",92,50.0,Washington

71021,US,"This is a blend of grapes from Mario's Vineyard and Central Park West Vineyard, both in St. Helena.

71023,US,"Though labeled as a red blend, at 94% this could be a varietally labeled Merlot and it drinks like it. Aromas of cocoa, raspberry and spice box are followed by plump, soft chocolate and raspberry flavors accented by tart acids that hold the balance through the finish.",90,49.0,Washington
71024,US,"A lovely Cabernet, smoky and rich, tannic and elegant, with the complexity and concentration that define Mount Veeder. With its smooth, velvety texture, cassis liqueur and new oak flavors, it's as flashy as anything out there.

71027,France,"A nice nose of black and blue berries with a hint of leather opens this value Syrah. Well built, it shows a bit of chocolate and decent length. There’s just a touch of green herb in there and it closes dry with fairly full tannins.",86,7.0,Languedoc-Roussillon
71028,South Africa,"Rich and round but not overdone, with a nice brightness to the apple, clementine and white peach aromas and flavors. Balanced and well-integrated, with all of the components working together in harmony. Closes on a brisk citrus-rind finish. Drink now–2014.",90,32.0,Stellenbosch
71029,Peru,"Radiator dust and Animal Cracker aromas are not typical of Sauvignon Blanc. On the palate, this opens with mild citric notes but quickly shifts to flatness. Pithy orange and apricot flavors finish yeasty, with a distant hint of citrus zest.",84,14.0,Ica
71030,Italy,"This opens with an unusual aroma that recalls floral air freshener, roasted coffee bean and a medicinal note. The palate is diluted with jumbled flavors of red apple skin, small berries and toasted walnuts. It has a green, bitter finish.",83,7.0,Tuscany

71032,Chile,"This is a standard SB that was made for near-term quaffing.

71044,US,"High toned and sharp edged, this should probably be consumed quickly. Scents of petrol run into a barely-ripe flavor of rhubarb.",83,20.0,Oregon
71045,US,"A curious wine. On the plus side is a tantalizingly tasty flavor, like fully-ripened raspberries and cherries crushed into a delicious nectar, then sprinkled with honey and white pepper. A good overlay of toasty oak adds richness. Yet there's a syrupy sweetness, like cough medicine, that detracts.",85,36.0,California
71046,US,"With 30% new oak, the wood stands out, giving the wine vanilla and buttered toast notes.

71050,France,"This very rich, wood-aged wine is dense and powerful. The power takes away from the natural balance of a Bordeaux, giving dark tannins that dominate. Spice from the wood is also a strong element. It will round out, but will remain very ripe.",86,25.0,Bordeaux
71051,New Zealand,"Ripe tropical fruit and toasty American oak are a traditional match in Gisborne, and the Ormond bottling from Brancott is a fine example. Sweet caramel, toast with honey and mixed tropical fruit aromas and flavors are rich and full but not heavy.",87,30.0,Gisborne

71057,Germany,"Char and roasted coffee notes lend a brooding, smoky backdrop to bright red berry and cherry flavors in this full-bodied Pinot Noir.

71062,France,"A pale copper color, this offers initial aromas of ripe peach, pineapple core and ripe strawberry, providing a lushly fruity impression on the nose.

71071,US,"This is the kind of elegant wine one expects from Chateau Lafayette, with its flirtation of mint, chocolate and soft pepper on the nose, and its integrated berry and spice flavors on the palate. Smooth but sturdy tannins and a long finish seal the deal.",87,55.0,New York
71072,US,"An aroma like maple syrup on waffles and similar, sweet-seeming flavors are reminiscent of breakfast, but this will pair well with slow-cooked barbecue. Most of that spicy sweetness comes from oak barrels or add-ins, complementing the full body and light tannins.",86,19.0,California

71078,US,"Drew used to release this bottling some 16 or 17 months after the vintage. This wine has been rushed to market at barely more than a year of age. As a result, this young wine shows the ripe flavors and structural integrity of earlier vintages, such as the wonderful 2007, but it's rude in jam and acids. If you buy it, do what the winery should have: store it for at least an additional year, and better yet, three.",90,40.0,California
71079,US,"The unique nose of this wine shows crystalline lime candy and nectarine flesh, along with a sharper yet plush tangerine blossom aroma.

71105,US,"The Loner title seems to refer to an absence of oak, although it's not entirely unoaked. The wine spent time in what the winemaker calls “seasoned barriques” that lent no overt oak influence, but let the wine breathe and mellow. Marked by intense lemon, lime and mineral flavors, this bone-dry wine is elegant and eccentric.",92,60.0,California

71113,Italy,"This blend of Cabernet Sauvignon and Sangiovese has a rather inexpressive nose that eventually reveals bell pepper, cedar and spice.

It lacks vibrancy and there's not enough fruit richness to stand up to the oak.",86,40.0,Tuscany
71114,Chile,"Slightly mulchy at first, with coffee grinds, leafy notes and mildly soupy red-fruit aromas.

Drink now through 2022.",95,200.0,California
71118,US,"This is a dark, big, dense Pinot Noir, and while some wines of this style are heavy and dull, this one isn't.

It's medium-bodied, crisp and dry yet with a sense of honeyed richness.",90,40.0,Rheinhessen
71131,Germany,"Intensely aromatic, intensely fruity, this Riesling packs a powerful punch of flavor within a delicate frame.

71245,New Zealand,"This medium-bodied Sauvignon Blanc smells like fruit cocktail, and the flavors that follow are pleasantly reminiscent of guava, but slightly one-dimensional. Finishes soft.",85,18.0,Marlborough
71246,Chile,"Sweaty, briny aromas are borderline offputting. This is plump on the palate, with flavors of pickled citrus fruits. The same can be said for the finish, which is also bitter, resiny and overoaked.",83,20.0,Casablanca Valley
71247,US,"Light in color this wine features gorgeous acidity and a lining of fresh, vibrant red cherry, adorned completely by a pretty rose-petal bouquet. Though gentle in color and body, the texture moves along, providing plenty of body to keep the wine freshly alive.",92,42.0,California
71248,France,"From an eight-acre vineyard, this is produced by the same team as Château Paloumey. Powerful and concentrated, it is also elegant, balancing its structure with good berry fruits and acidity. The tannins are still considerable, so drink from 2017.",90,50.0,Bordeaux
71249,US,"This medium-bodied wine has earthy, almost salty aromas, good acidity, herb and melon flavors and a fresh mouthfeel. Its sea-breeze character suggests seafood as a good pairing.",85,34.0,California
71250,US,"If you think you don't like Merlot, try this one. It shows classic Napa Valley structure, with smooth, firm tannins and seductive flavors of sweet cherries, plums and currants. Delicious now with a good steak.",91,32.0,California
71251,France,"This is as serious as Provence rosé can get. It is a limited production wine, selected from the best Grenache (75%) and Syrah (25%) parcels. Structured and impressively dense, its red fruits are concentrated, bone-dry and with a textured character. It is ready to drink although it will become richer from early 2016. The Sumeire family arrived in the Sainte Victoire mountain range in the 13th century.",93,60.0,Provence
71252,US,"Earthy funk and black tea surround dampened mushrooms, giving this wine a feral quality before a lift of red rhubarb and strawberry pie provide juicy succulence. Cola and vanilla make appearances toward the finish, which builds in intensity of oak.",88,32.0,California
71253,US,"Strawberry jam accented in black cherry form the essence of this medium-bodied wine with high-strung acidity. It seems to speak to a fair amount of winemaking more than to a specific site, showing oak and earth on the finish.",86,89.0,California
71254,France,"A single glass serving in a glass tube, this is a soft wine, with a warm feel to it, offering some yeasty character as well as ripe quince and pear flavors.",85,,Loire Valley
71255,US,"Simple and straightforward, this Chardonnay has notes of vanilla, caramel and oak. A bite of sweet baked apple is most pronounced on the finish.",86,15.0,California
71256,US,"Lush and vibrantly balanced, this wine is marked by juicy layers of blueberry, huckleberry and spicy cola and clove. Velvety-smooth on the palate, it's a satisfying, medium-bodied effort that effectively shows the beauty of the site and the vintage.",93,52.0,California
71257,France,"Notions of ripe lemon and mandarin zest play upon nose and palate of this admirably dry Riesling, which has enough concentration to carry the riot of citrus perfectly. This refreshing, clean and bracing wine could be your rescue on a hot summer day.",90,36.0,Alsace
71258,Chile,"A little rough all the way along, with olive, black cherry and blackberry aromas yielding to mildly tart berry flavors. Acidity is jumpy and twangy, making the wine a little hot and streaky. But that intensity will serve it well if you're drinking it with a burger or skirt steak. Imported by Excelsior Wine & Spirits.",84,10.0,Central Valley
71259,US,"Surprisingly mature in both color and flavor development, this mixes a flavor of rhubarb pie with brown sugar accents. Soft and approachable in style this should be consumed soon.",86,24.0,Oregon
71260,Italy,"Made with 70% Cabernet Sauvignon, 15% Merlot, 10% Petit Verdot and 5% Cabernet Franc, this bold wine opens with aromas of black currant, cedar and exotic spice. The concentrated palate delivers blueberry jam, graphite, anise and clove alongside assertive tannins that leave a firm finish.",90,58.0,Tuscany
71261,Italy,"Aromas of dark berry, wild flower, Mediterranean brush and dried herb lead the nose on this structured wine. The ripe, delicious palate boasts juicy red cherry, crushed raspberry, cinnamon and anise flavors that are framed in velvety tannins. It's balanced and elegant, with an energizing mineral finish. Drink through 2022.",93,58.0,Sicily & Sardinia
71262,France,It's almost worth buying this bottling just for the extravagant medieval label design. Luckily the wine is lives up to the heraldic billing. It is rich while also well structured. Juicy berry fruits and fresh black currant acidity show well against a still-tannic structure. The wine comes from the Moreaud family. Drink from 2017.,90,40.0,Bordeaux
71263,US,"Light and tart, this brings cranberry and pepper flavors, which lead into a swift, sharp, tannic finish.",85,12.0,Washington
71264,Argentina,"Fresh, layered aromas of black fruits and licorice are appealing. The palate is full and offers kick, while flavors of berry and plum are fairly rich, spicy and honest for $9 Cabernet.

71265,US,"Dry and crisp, this is elegant, with a silky mouthfeel carrying flavors of sour blackberry candy and cranberrys. It has a certain complexity that's pleasurable.",87,20.0,California
71266,Argentina,"This wine has showed no consistency over the years. This vintage is black and extracted with piercing inky blackberry aromas. In the mouth, it's huge, chunky and grating. Overdone black-fruit flavors finish clampy with oaky bitterness and a sense of reduction.",84,19.0,Mendoza Province
71267,France,"A touch of wood helps the wine's light fruit to deepen and become richer. The wine is well balanced, with fresh acidity giving a good lift.",85,15.0,Bordeaux
71268,US,"Dark boysenberry, dried purple flowers, wet slate and a touch of bay leaf show on the nose of this thick and earthy bottling by the tech moguls T.J. and Valeta Rodgers. The mouthfeel is very chalky, and there is the winery's characteristic earthiness along with mocha and baking spice. But there are also brighter berry flavors, perhaps due to the sunnier slopes.",93,62.0,California
71269,US,"Made from Kiona Vineyards fruit, this Red Mountain Cabernet Sauvignon has the dark fruit and the dense tannins one might expect. But that meaty power is leavened by natural acidity. A highlight of orange peel accents the deep flavors of cassis and smoke. It turns a little chalky at the tail end.",90,50.0,Washington
71270,France,"Very Pommard, very structured, this is a dense and dark wine that shows big black fruits over dry tannins. It's big, firm, muscular, a powerhouse of firmness and richness.",90,,Burgundy
71271,US,"Lives up to its reserve status, being the creamiest and most densely packed of Roche's several new Chardonnays. With brisk, bright acidity and ripe flavors of pineapples, Key lime pie and vanilla cream, its buttered toast and char flavors provide the perfect counterpoint from oak barrel aging.",93,35.0,California
71272,US,"There's nothing subtle about this blush wine made from Zinfandel. It was barrel fermented and barrel aged for 15 months, giving it a full-bodied mouthfeel and even some dusty tannins, and it has robust flavors of cherries, cola, beef jerky and licorice. But it's dry and crisp and is something different.",85,22.0,California
71273,Chile,"The standard Sauvignon Blanc aromas of lime and mineral define the nose of this wine. It tastes juicy to an extreme, with fruit flavors of nectarine and apple that don't rise to a high level. It's tangy, candied and bright on the finish.",84,11.0,Lolol Valley
71274,US,"This light and fruity wine offers fresh peach flavors, with a burst of lemon candy. It's off dry and finishes with a sugary kick.",85,18.0,Oregon
71275,US,"A blend of several vineyard sites, including Riddle and Pratt, this is a knockout, a testament to fine winemaking in its soft, velvety texture and buoyant acidity and structure. Orange and strawberry provide a tangy ripeness complemented in earth and clove. This is one worth stocking up on.",93,42.0,California
71276,Chile,"After a foxy, jumpy smelling bouquet with animal fur aromas and minerality, this six-grape blend settles and shows its better colors, namely ripe baked-fruit flavors, a whack of oaky vanilla and lastly a modest, smooth finish with just enough acidity to provide kick and pizzazz. Give this blocky, full-bodied blend time in the glass and it will reward you. Drink through 2018.",90,34.0,Colchagua Valley
71277,Chile,"Lanolin and squash aromas indicate that this is fading. The palate is wide and fleshy but lacking in a focal point. Flavors of spiced pumpkin and aged apple are a bit like holiday pie, while modest acidity on the finish ensures that this is bland on the exit.",86,16.0,Rapel Valley
71278,US,"Luscious melon aromas, creamy fruit-tart flavors and a silky texture make a pleasing combination in this wonderfully soothing wine.

71280,Austria,"Morello cherry is the central note here—almost candied but wonderfully ripe—with a juicy, almost bouncy body of fruity freshness. The acidity is bright but buffered by plenty of fruit. This is huge fun to drink, with or without food.",87,39.0,Niederösterreich
71281,US,"The well-known négociant continues to amaze with affordable yet tasty wines. This bottling shows ripe raspberry, teriyaki, beef jerky, chocolate and chalk on the nose. The palate discloses bacon fat and roasted pork at first, then leans toward cloves, anise and beef blood. It's quite easy to drink.",88,18.0,California
71282,France,"Lovely pure notes of red crunchy cherry dominate the nose. They are also present on the slender, almost slight, palate that is completely dry but full of the charm of the fruit. Ample freshness brightens the entire wine which is well-suited to being chilled. It's a friendly easy charming red.",89,18.0,Alsace
71283,Argentina,"Subtle on the nose, with restrained berry, cherry and citrus peel aromas. The palate is a little grabby but mostly fresh in its approach, with flavors of fresh berry fruit. Light and mildly candied on the finish. A no-brainer that's easy as they come.",85,15.0,Other
71284,US,Mild aromas of citrus cream and sea spray mark the nose. Broader stone fruit flavors give weight to the palate that doesn't seem to quite balance out by the sugary finish.,84,26.0,Michigan

71288,Italy,"Made with organic grapes, this fruity blend of 90% Sangiovese and 10% Canaiolo/Colorino begins with aromas of ripe red berries, spice and espresso. The dense palate delivers fleshy black cherry, black pepper and balsamic herbs supported by youthfully aggressive, chewy tannins. Drink 2015–2020.",89,29.0,Tuscany
71289,Germany,"Thirty bucks may seem like a lot for an entry-level Riesling, but this is an exemplary example. Aromas of wet stones, moss and spring flowers are mouthwatering, and then are followed by a complex array of nonfruity flavors, like stones and greens carried along by a mouthfeel that's light as a feather. Tart pineapple emerges on the long finish. Drink anytime over the next 10 years.",90,29.0,Mosel
71290,France,"This is a spicy wine, soft and open. Its tannins and red berry fruits have a diffuse character that takes away the focus of the wine. It will age quickly.",83,21.0,Bordeaux
71291,US,"Lots of sweet, ripe cherries in this Syrah, which also shows classic, cool-climate aromas of black pepper. A disagreeable note of crushed cigarette butts is a big minus.",83,32.0,California
71292,US,"This Pinot is a little tough in the mouth, but the tart red cherry, cranberry, strawberry jam and sandalwood flavors are complex and enjoyable. Give it a few hours in the decanter and drink up.",87,23.0,California
71293,US,"Run, don't walk, to buy this wonderful Merlot by the case. An unbelievable buy from Goldschmidt Vineyards, which is doing some of the most interesting things in Sonoma Bordeaux wines, it's a soft, ripe, complex wine that shows the balance and structure of a far more expensive bottling. Brims with briary cherry, blackberry, chocolate, cedar and spice flavors that were born for charbroiled steak.",90,14.0,California
71294,US,"Nutty and lush with layers of peach, pear and lime fruit, this is a medium-bodied and well-balanced white. It's refreshing while offering both length and breadth on the palate.",91,31.0,California
71295,US,"The winery's '05 Cab is tannic and dry and elegant. It tastes like a young Bordeaux, a wine that needs time in the cellar to come around. The flavors are classic Napa Cab, all black currants, black cherries and oak. Just beautiful. Best after 2009, but good now with decanting and a big, important steak.",92,50.0,California
71296,Spain,"Glaring oak on the nose results in notes of clove, chocolate and spice to go with generic but ripe black-fruit scents. This blend of Monastrell, Syrah and Petit Verdot feels heavy and syrupy, while flavors of maple, toasted oak, chocolate and clove finish ripe, but also sweet and candied.",87,15.0,Levante
71297,France,"With entrancing smoky aromas, this is a ripe, intense and powerful wine. The tannins are dry, contrasting with the black fruit-juice flavors, black chocolate and a dry final taste. For long-term aging.",95,,Burgundy
71298,Spain,"Smells like hickory-smoked barbecue with earthy berry and dill. The palate is rubbery in feel, with drying tannins and savory tasting red fruit flavors that are a touch resiny. Spice and berry notes work the finish.",85,14.0,Northern Spain
71299,US,"This newly released still wine from sparkling specialist Gloria Ferrer is a successful first effort, blending bright cherry, strawberry and tangy blood orange flavors. With an earthy hint of compost and forest, it celebrates the variety in all its glory, upholding its acidity beneath a weight of richness.",92,80.0,California
71300,Chile,"After a quick start of citrus and grass aromas, the bouquet loses clarity and becomes mealy and old smelling. Acidity keeps the palate afloat but the longer this sits, the more briny and pickled it tastes. Drink fast for some citrus character.",81,15.0,Limarí Valley
71301,Chile,"Mildly snappy nettle, passion fruit and tangerine aromas are a nice entry to this spunky but basic SB. Lime and tarragon flavors quickly fall off on a light finish.",86,10.0,Casablanca Valley
71302,US,"Dryness and acidity mark this terrific wine. It's one for connoisseurs, a Pinot that requires some understanding to fully appreciate, as it's not a hedonistic seducer. The cherry and blackberry flavors have a fruit-skin bitterness, and there are additional nuances of violets, cola, leather, balsam and smoky oak. This is certainly one for the cellar. Drink now, with decanting, and over the next eight years.",94,65.0,California
71303,Spain,"Horsey berry and vinegar aromas lack freshness and appeal. This feels both tight and dilute, while flavors of forced oak, tomato and tart berry fruits finish drawing and bitter.",83,10.0,Northern Spain
71304,France,"This is a ripe, wood laden wine. It has red plum and damson flavors overladen by notes of burnt toast and smoke. Acidity shows through on the finish.",87,,Loire Valley

71308,Chile,"Big, herbal and rich on the nose, with minerality and a lot of olive and black-fruit aromas. The palate is round, full-bodied and chewy, with ample oak, herbal flavors and blackberry. Tasty, robust and not short on oak and herbal notes. In a word, it's Chilean Cabernet Sauvignon.",88,21.0,Aconcagua Valley
71309,Germany,"Ripe and peachy in style, with accents of brine, honey and cinnamon. It's round and voluptuous in the mouth, then gains focus and crispness on the finish, finishing without an excess of sugar. Try it anytime over the next 6–8 years.",90,17.0,Mosel
71310,US,"Was it the chilly vintage that made this wine so elusive? Tasted in the spring, it was oaky and jammy with raspberries and cherries, with the astringent tannins of green herb tea. Hard to tell where it's going, if anywhere, but it does have dryness and vital acidity in its favor.",87,60.0,California
71311,US,"Bright lemon and crisp apple aromas lead to similar but richer flavors, supported by firm acidity for balance. It makes for a lively but flavorful package that both tastes great and is versatile with food.",89,13.0,California
71312,Italy,"Ripe notes of cherry, black fruit, dried apple skin and tobacco leaf appear on the nose of this Merlot-Cabernet Sauvignon-Cabernet Franc-Marzemino blend. The wine is chewy and dense in the mouth but there's a slightly bitter note on the close that comes as a surprise.",87,62.0,Veneto

71315,US,"Full and roundly lush, this is a big, bold wine from a specially selected site within an estate vineyard. It imparts smoked meat alongside rich, spiced plum, an undercurrent of rosemary and herbes de Provence whipping in between the fruit and generous tannin.",92,80.0,California
71316,US,"Very ripe and jammy in raspberry and cherry fruit flavors, this Pinot is accented with crisp acidity. Oak barrel aging adds notes of caramel and buttered toast. It's a deliciously dry wine, although a bit direct and obvious. Seems at its best now and for 3–4 years.",90,46.0,California
71317,US,"The aromas of this rosé of Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot and Cabernet Franc are direct and reminiscent of red currant jam on toast. Medium bodied and broad in feel, this has acids that offer plenty of cut, plus a touch of grapefruit zest that adds interest.",86,14.0,Virginia

It does show some slightly chewy, dusty tannins on the finish, but the fruit ultimately wins through, suggesting it will be at its best from 2010–2020.",90,19.0,South Australia
